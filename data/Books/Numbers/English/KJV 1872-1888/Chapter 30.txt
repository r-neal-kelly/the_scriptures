⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the thing which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath commanded.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ If a man vow a vow unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:profane⸩pr·fane⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ If a woman also vow a vow unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and bind ⸨i⸩herself⸨/i⸩ by a bond, ⸨i⸩being⸨/i⸩ in her fatherʼs house in her youth;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And if she had at all an husband, when ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩her vows⸨/i⸩ were ⸨i⸩upon her⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And her husband heard ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall forgive her.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And if she vowed in her husbandʼs house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And her husband heard ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, and held his peace at her, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨i⸩then⸨/i⸩ whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall forgive her.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩then he shall bear her iniquity.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ These ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the statutes, which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, ⸨i⸩being yet⸨/i⸩ in her youth in her fatherʼs house.⸨marg⸩
