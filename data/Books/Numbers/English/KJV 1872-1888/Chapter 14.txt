⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And wherefore hath the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, ⸨i⸩which were⸨/i⸩ of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ an exceeding good land.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ If the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ Only rebel not ye against the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ bread for us: their ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩defence is departed from them, and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with us: fear them not.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩shadow⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Moses said unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, Then the Egyptians shall hear ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Exod⸼ ⸨fix:32⸼⸩32⸨/fix⸩⸨fix: ⸩, ⸨/fix⸩12⸼

⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ Because the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was not ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Deut⸼ 9⸼ 28⸼
