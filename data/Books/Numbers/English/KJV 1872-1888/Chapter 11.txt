⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And Moses said unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ I am not able to bear all this people alone, because ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ too heavy for me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ upon thee, and will put ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ not thyself alone.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for ⸨i⸩it was⸨/i⸩ well with us in Egypt: therefore the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩But⸨/i⸩ even a ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩month of days⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩e⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Is the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩e⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Isai⸼ ⸨fix:50⸼⸩··⸨/fix⸩ 2⸼⸨row⸩& 59⸼ 1⸼
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ upon him, and gave ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩, ⸨/i⸩⸩, ⸨/fix⸩when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ But there remained two ⸨i⸩of the⸨/i⸩ men in the camp, the name of the one ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, ⸨i⸩one⸨/i⸩ of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ people were prophets, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ would put his spirit upon them!⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.⸨marg⸩
