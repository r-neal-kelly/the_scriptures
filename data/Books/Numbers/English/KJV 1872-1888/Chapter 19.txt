⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ yet upon him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ unclean.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.⸨marg⸩
