⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And Israel vowed a vow unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ For Heshbon ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.⸨marg⸩
