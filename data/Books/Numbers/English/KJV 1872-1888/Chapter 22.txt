⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan ⸨i⸩by⸨/i⸩ Jericho.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all ⸨i⸩that are⸨/i⸩ round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ king of the Moabites at that time.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩face of the earth, and they abide over against me:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Josh⸼ ⸨fix:24⸼⸩24⸨/fix⸩⸨fix: ⸩, ⸨/fix⸩9⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩eye⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ we may smite them, and ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ these with thee?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me⸨fix:⸨i⸩, ⸨/i⸩⸩, ⸨/fix⸩⸨i⸩saying⸨/i⸩,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ Behold, ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩I shall ⸨fix:prevail⸩pre·a·l⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:in⸩i·⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:fighting⸩figh···g⸨/fix⸩ against him⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ blessed.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ refuseth to give me leave to go with you.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Be not thou letted from, &c⸼⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ my God, to do less or more.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 24⸼ 13⸼
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will say unto me more.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Godʼs anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ with him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ the ass saw the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 Pet⸼ 2⸼ ⸨fix:16⸼⸩16⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩Jude 11⸼
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ But the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall ⸨i⸩being⸨/i⸩ on this side, and a wall on that side.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And when the ass saw the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaamʼs foot against the wall: and he smote her again.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ And the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ went further, and stood in a narrow place, where ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ And when the ass saw the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaamʼs anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ And the ass said unto Balaam, ⸨i⸩Am⸨/i⸩ not I thine ass, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩upon which thou hast ridden ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ever since ⸨i⸩I was⸨/i⸩ thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee?

⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ Then the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩fell flat on his face.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or⸨fix:, ⸩. ⸨/fix⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:bowed⸩b···d⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:himself⸩hims···⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ And the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩to withstand thee, because ⸨i⸩thy⸨/i⸩ way is perverse before me:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩Heb⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩to ⸨fix:be an⸩b···⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:adversary⸩ad·····⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:unto⸩·nto⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:thee⸩··⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩34⸨/sub⸩ And Balaam said unto the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩displease thee, I will get me back again.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸩ ⸨/fix⸩Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:be⸩··⸨/fix⸩ evil in thine eyes⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩35⸨/sub⸩ And the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩36⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the border of Arnon, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the utmost coast.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩37⸨/sub⸩ And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩38⸨/sub⸩ And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩39⸨/sub⸩ And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Kirjath‑huzoth.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩A city ⸨fix:of⸩··⸨/fix⸩ streets⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩40⸨/sub⸩ And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ with him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩41⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost ⸨i⸩part⸨/i⸩ of the people.⸨marg⸩
