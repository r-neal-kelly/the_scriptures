⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on ⸨i⸩every⸨/i⸩ altar a bullock and a ram.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩he went ⸨fix:to⸩··⸨/fix⸩ an high place.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩he went solitary⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon ⸨i⸩every⸨/i⸩ altar a bullock and a ram.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ put a word in Balaamʼs mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, ⸨i⸩saying⸨/i⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩, ⸨/i⸩⸩, ⸨/fix⸩Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, ⸨i⸩whom⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath not defied?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth ⸨i⸩part⸨/i⸩ of Israel? Let ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩my soul⸨/i⸩ or, ⸨i⸩my life⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ altogether.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath put in my mouth?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on ⸨i⸩every⸨/i⸩ altar.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩The hill⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet ⸨i⸩the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩⸨/i⸩ yonder.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ met Balaam, and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ ⸨fix:22⸼⸩22⸨/fix⸩ 35⸼
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spoken?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ God ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨fix:? ⸩⸨i⸩? ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ Behold, I have received ⸨i⸩commandment⸨/i⸩ to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ his God ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with him, and the shout of a king ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ among them.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ Surely ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ no enchantment ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩against Jacob, neither ⸨i⸩is there⸨/i⸩ any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Or⸩·r⸨/fix⸩, ⸨i⸩in⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ speaketh, that I must do?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.⸨marg⸩
