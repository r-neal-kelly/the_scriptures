⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩Now⸨/sc⸩ these ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the nations which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ left, to prove Israel by them, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ as many ⸨i⸩of Israel⸨/i⸩ as had not known all the wars of Canaan;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩Namely⸨/i⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩, ⸨/i⸩⸩, ⸨/fix⸩five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal‑hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, which he commanded their fathers by the hand ⸨fix:of⸩·f⸨/fix⸩ Moses.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and forgat the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ their God, and served Baalim and the groves.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Therefore the anger of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan‑rishathaim king of ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan‑rishathaim eight years.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Aram‑naharaim⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And when the children of Israel cried unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ raised up a ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebʼs younger brother.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩saviour⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And the Spirit of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ delivered Chushan‑rishathaim king of ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan‑rishathaim.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Aram⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ But when the children of Israel cried unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩a Benjamite, a man ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩left‑handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩the son of Jemini⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩shut of his right hand⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ a very fat man.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ But he himself turned again from the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩quarries that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩graven images⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ seat.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a parlour ⸨fix:of⸩o·⸨/fix⸩ cooling⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩the dirt came out.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩it came out at the fundament⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ locked, they said, Surely he ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩covereth his feet in his summer chamber.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩doth his easement⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩and, behold, their lord ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ fallen down dead on the earth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸨fix:lusty⸩·usty⸨/fix⸩, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩fat⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.⸨marg⸩
