⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, when the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And they called the name of that place ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That is, ⸨i⸩Weepers⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And the people served the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the ⸨fix:elders⸩·lders⸨/fix⸩ that ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, that he did for Israel.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩prolonged days after Joshua⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, died, ⸨i⸩being⸨/i⸩ an hundred and ten years old.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath‑heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and served Baalim:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And they forsook the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ to anger.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And they forsook the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the anger of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands ⸨fix:of⸩o·⸨/fix⸩ spoilers that spoiled them, and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ he sold them into the hands of their ⸨fix:enemies⸩enemi·s⸨/fix⸩ round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ps⸼ 44⸼ 12⸼⸨row⸩Isai⸼ 50⸼ 1⸼
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was against them for evil, as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had said, and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Lev⸼ 26⸼⸨row⸩Deut⸼ 28⸼
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Nevertheless the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ raised up judges, which ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩saved⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ they did not so.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And when the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ raised them up judges, then the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:g⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ when the judge was dead, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ they returned, and ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩corrupted ⸨i⸩themselves⸨/i⸩ more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩they ceased not from their own doings⸨fix:, ⸩ ⸨/fix⸩nor from their stubborn way.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:g⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 3⸼ 12⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩were corrupt⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩they let nothing fall of their⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the anger of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ to walk therein, as their fathers did keep ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, or not.⸨marg⸩
