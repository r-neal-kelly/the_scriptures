⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Manoah; and his wife ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ barren, and bare not.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean ⸨i⸩thing⸨/i⸩⸨fix::⸩⸨i⸩:⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Num⸼ 6⸼ ⸨fix:2⸼⸩2⸨/fix⸩, 3⸼
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Num⸼ 6⸼ 5⸼⸨row⸩1 Sam⸼ 1⸼ 11⸼
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩, neither told he me his name:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean ⸨i⸩thing⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Then Manoah intreated the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came ⸨fix:again⸩·gain⸨/fix⸩ unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ not with her.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the ⸨i⸩other⸨/i⸩ day.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, ⸨i⸩Art⸨/i⸩ thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩How shall we order the child, and ⸨sup⸩❙✝⸨/sup⸩⸨i⸩how⸨/i⸩ shall we do unto him?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩What shall be the manner of the⸨/i⸩, &c⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, what ⸨i⸩shall he do?⸨/i⸩⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ what shall be ⸨i⸩his work?⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ She may not eat of any ⸨i⸩thing⸨/i⸩ that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean ⸨i⸩thing⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩all that I commanded her let her observe.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Manoah said unto the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩for thee.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩before thee⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩. For Manoah knew not that he ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ an angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And Manoah said unto the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, What ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩secret?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩wonderful⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ upon a rock unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: and ⸨i⸩the angel⸨/i⸩ did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, and fell on their faces to the ground.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ But the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ an angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And Manoah said unto his wife, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ We shall surely die, because we have seen God.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ex⸼ 33⸼ 20⸼⸨row⸩ch⸼ 6⸼ 22⸼
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ But his wife said unto him, If the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these ⸨i⸩things⸨/i⸩, nor would as at this time have told us ⸨i⸩such things⸨/i⸩ as these.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ blessed him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And the Spirit of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.⸨marg⸩
