⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And now the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ unto the land of your possession, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ which Moses the servant of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ gave you on the other side Jordan.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Num⸼ 32⸼ 33⸼⸨row⸩ch⸼ 13⸼ 8⸼
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ charged you, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ to love the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Deu⸼ 10⸼ 12⸼
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ by the hand of Moses.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And when the children of Israel heard ⸨i⸩of it⸨/i⸩, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And with him ten princes, of each ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩house of the father⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ Thus saith the whole congregation of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, What trespass ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ the iniquity ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩,⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Num⸼ 25⸼ 4⸼

⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ unclean, ⸨i⸩then⸨/i⸩ pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, wherein the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ our God.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 7⸼ ⸨fix:1⸼⸩1⸨/fix⸩, 5⸼

⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ That we have built us an altar to turn from following the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ himself require ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨fix:;⸩⸨i⸩;⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨marg⸩
