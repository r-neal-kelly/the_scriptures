⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ ye slack to go to possess the land, which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of your fathers hath given you?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Give out from among you three men for ⸨i⸩each⸨/i⸩ tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come ⸨i⸩again⸨/i⸩ to me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Ye shall therefore describe the land ⸨i⸩into⸨/i⸩ seven parts, and bring ⸨i⸩the description⸨/i⸩ hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ our God.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ gave them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ in Shiloh.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came ⸨i⸩again⸨/i⸩ to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth‑aven.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Beth‑el, southward; and the border descended to Ataroth‑adar, near the hill that ⸨i⸩lieth⸨/i⸩ on the south side of the nether Beth‑horon.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And the border was drawn ⸨i⸩thence⸨/i⸩, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that ⸨i⸩lieth⸨/i⸩ before Beth‑horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath‑baal, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Kirjath‑jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the west quarter.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And the south quarter ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ from the end of Kirjath‑jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And the border came down to the end of the mountain that ⸨i⸩lieth⸨/i⸩ before the valley of the son of Hinnom, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En‑rogel,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En‑shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 15⸼ 6⸼
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And passed along toward the side over against ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩The ⸨fix:plain⸩pla·n⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And the border passed along to the side of Beth‑hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the south coast.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩tongue⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth‑hoglah, and the valley of Keziz.⸨marg⸩
