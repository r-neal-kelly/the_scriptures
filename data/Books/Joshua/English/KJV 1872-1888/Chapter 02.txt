⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass ⸨i⸩about the time⸨/i⸩ of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And she said unto the men, I know that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩faint because of you.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩melt⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ For we have heard how the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ on the other side Jordan, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ex⸼ 14⸼ 21⸼⸨row⸩ch⸼ 4⸼ ⸨fix:23⸼⸩2·⸼⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Num⸼ ⸨fix:21⸼⸩21⸨/fix⸩⸨fix: ⸩, ⸨/fix⸩24⸼
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And as soon as we had heard ⸨i⸩these things⸨/i⸩, our hearts did melt, neither ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God, he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩rose up⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my fatherʼs house, and give me a true token:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And the men answered her, Our life ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩for yourʼs, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩instead of you to die⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And the men said unto her, We ⸨i⸩will be⸨/i⸩ blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ Behold, ⸨i⸩when⸨/i⸩ we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy fatherʼs household, home unto thee.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩gather⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And it shall be, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ upon his head, and we ⸨i⸩will be⸨/i⸩ guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ on our head, if ⸨i⸩any⸨/i⸩ hand be upon him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And she said, According unto your words, so ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ throughout all the way, but found ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ not.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ ¶ So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all ⸨i⸩things⸨/i⸩ that befell them:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And they said unto Joshua, Truly the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩faint because of us.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩melt⸨/i⸩.
