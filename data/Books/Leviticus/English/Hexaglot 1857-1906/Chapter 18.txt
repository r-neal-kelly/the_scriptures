⸨cen⸩CHAPTER XVIII⸼

1 ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake unto Moses, saying,
2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God.
3 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.
4 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God.
5 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
6 ¶ None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover ⸨i⸩their⸨/i⸩ nakedness: I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
7 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
8 The nakedness of thy fatherʼs wife shalt thou not uncover: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy fatherʼs nakedness.
9 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, ⸨i⸩whether she be⸨/i⸩ born at home, or born abroad, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
10 The nakedness of thy sonʼs daughter, or of thy daughterʼs daughter, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirʼs ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thine own nakedness.
11 The nakedness of thy fatherʼs wifeʼs daughter, begotten of thy father, she ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
12 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy fatherʼs sister: she ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy fatherʼs near kinswoman.
13 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy motherʼs sister: for she ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy motherʼs near kinswoman.
14 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy fatherʼs brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thine aunt.
15 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy sonʼs wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
16 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brotherʼs wife: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy brotherʼs nakedness.
17 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her sonʼs daughter, or her daughterʼs daughter, to uncover her nakedness; ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ they ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ her near kinswomen: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ wickedness.
18 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex ⸨i⸩her⸨/i⸩, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life ⸨i⸩time⸨/i⸩.
19 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.
20 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbourʼs wife, to defile thyself with her.
21 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through ⸨i⸩the fire⸨/i⸩ to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind, it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ abomination.
23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ confusion.
24 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:
25 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
26 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit ⸨i⸩any⸨/i⸩ of these abominations; ⸨i⸩neither⸨/i⸩ any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:
27 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ before you, and the land is defiled;)
28 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ before you.
29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ shall be cut off from among their people.
30 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ⸨i⸩ye⸨/i⸩ commit not ⸨i⸩any one⸨/i⸩ of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God.
