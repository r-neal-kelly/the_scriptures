⸨cen⸩CHAPTER II⸼

1 ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ when any will offer a meat offering unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, his offering shall be ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:
2 And he shall bring it to Aaronʼs sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩:
3 And the remnant of the meat offering ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ Aaronʼs and his sonsʼ: ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ a thing most holy of the offerings of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ made by fire.
4 ¶ And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, ⸨i⸩it shall be⸨/i⸩ unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
5 ¶ And if thy oblation ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ a meat offering ⸨i⸩baken⸨/i⸩ in a pan, it shall be ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.
6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a meat offering.
7 ¶ And if thy oblation ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ a meat offering ⸨i⸩baken⸨/i⸩ in the fryingpan, it shall be made ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ fine flour with oil.
8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.
9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ upon the altar: ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
10 And that which is left of the meat offering ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ Aaronʼs and his sonsʼ: ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ a thing most holy of the offerings of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ made by fire.
11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ made by fire.
12 ¶ As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.
13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.
14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ corn beaten out of full ears.
15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a meat offering.
16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, ⸨i⸩part⸨/i⸩ of the beaten corn thereof, and ⸨i⸩part⸨/i⸩ of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ an offering made by fire unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
