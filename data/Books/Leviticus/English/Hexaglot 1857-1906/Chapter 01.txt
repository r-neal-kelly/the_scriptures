⸨cen⸩LEVITICUS, CHAPTER I⸼

1 ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ of the herd, and of the flock.
3 If his offering ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
5 And he shall kill the bullock before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: and the priests, Aaronʼs sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that ⸨i⸩is by⸨/i⸩ the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.
7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:
8 And the priests, Aaronʼs sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ on the fire which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ upon the altar:
9 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
10 ¶ And if his offering ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ of the flocks, ⸨i⸩namely⸨/i⸩⸨err:, ⸩⸨i⸩, ⸨/i⸩⸨/err⸩of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.
11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: and the priests, Aaronʼs sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.
12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ on the fire which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ upon the altar:
13 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ all, and burn ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ upon the altar: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
14 ¶ And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.
15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:
16 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:
17 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ shall not divide ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ upon the fire: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
