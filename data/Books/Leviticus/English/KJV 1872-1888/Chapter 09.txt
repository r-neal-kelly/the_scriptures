⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ it came to pass on the eighth day, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto Aaron, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Exod⸼ 29⸼ 1⸼
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, ⸨i⸩both⸨/i⸩ of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will appear unto you.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And they brought ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And Moses said, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the thing which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall appear unto you.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ commanded.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ for himself.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ commanded Moses.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaronʼs sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ upon the altar.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ upon the burnt offering on the altar.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And he brought the peopleʼs offering, and took the goat, which ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩manner.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩ordinance⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And he brought the meat offering, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩took an handful thereof, and burnt ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ upon the altar, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩filled his hand out of it⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Exod⸼ 29⸼ 38⸼
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ He slew also the bullock and the ram ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ a sacrifice of peace offerings, which ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ for the people: and Aaronʼs sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth ⸨i⸩the inwards⸨/i⸩, and the kidneys, and the caul ⸨i⸩above⸨/i⸩ the liver:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ a wave offering before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; as Moses commanded.⸨marg⸩
