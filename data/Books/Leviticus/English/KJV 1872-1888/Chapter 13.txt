⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh ⸨i⸩like⸨/i⸩ the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩swelling⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and ⸨i⸩when⸨/i⸩ the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ deeper than the skin of his flesh, it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ If the bright spot ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up ⸨i⸩him that hath⸨/i⸩ the plague seven days:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, ⸨i⸩if⸨/i⸩ the plague in his sight be at a stay, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, ⸨i⸩if⸨/i⸩ the plague ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ somewhat dark, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it ⸨i⸩is but⸨/i⸩ a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨i⸩if⸨/i⸩ the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a leprosy.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ ¶ When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And the priest shall see ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩and, behold, ⸨i⸩if⸨/i⸩ the rising ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and ⸨i⸩there be⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩quick raw flesh in the rising;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩the quickening of living flesh⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of ⸨i⸩him that hath⸨/i⸩ the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, ⸨i⸩if⸨/i⸩ the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ clean ⸨i⸩that hath⸨/i⸩ the plague: it is all turned white: he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ clean.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ the raw flesh ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ unclean: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a leprosy.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And the priest shall see him: and, behold, ⸨i⸩if⸨/i⸩ the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ clean ⸨i⸩that hath⸨/i⸩ the plague: he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ clean.⸨marg⸩
