⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ What man soever ⸨i⸩there be⸨/i⸩ of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ out of the camp,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ before the tabernacle of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:⸨marg⸩
