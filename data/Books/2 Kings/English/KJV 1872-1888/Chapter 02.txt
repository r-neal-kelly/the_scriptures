⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath sent me to Beth‑el. And Elisha said ⸨i⸩unto him⸨/i⸩, ⸨i⸩As⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ liveth, and ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth‑el.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And the sons of the prophets that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ at Beth‑el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩hold ye your peace.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, ⸨i⸩As⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ liveth, and ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And the sons of the prophets that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩hold ye your peace.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, ⸨i⸩As⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ liveth, and ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ thy ⸨fix:soul⸩s·ul⸨/fix⸩ liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:in⸩i·⸨/fix⸩ sight⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩over against⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither ⸨fix:and⸩·nd⸨/fix⸩ thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion ⸨fix:of⸩o·⸨/fix⸩ thy spirit be upon me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And he said, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Thou hast asked a hard thing: ⸨i⸩nevertheless⸨/i⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩, ⸨/i⸩⸩, ⸨/fix⸩if thou see me ⸨i⸩when I am⸨/i⸩ taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it ⸨fix:shall⸩s hall⸨/fix⸩ not be ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Thou hast ⸨fix:done⸩d··e⸨/fix⸩ hard in asking⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, ⸨i⸩there appeared⸨/i⸩ a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ecclus⸼ 48⸼ 9⸼⸨row⸩1 Mac⸼ 2⸼ 58⸼
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Elisha saw ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, and he cried, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 13⸼ 14⸼
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩bank of Jordan;⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩lip⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And when the sons of the prophets which ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩⸨/sup⸩ ver⸼ ⸨fix:7⸼⸩7⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath taken him up, and cast him upon ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩sons of strength⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩one ⸨fix:of⸩o·⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:the⸩th·⸨/fix⸩ mountains⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ naught, and the ground ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩barren.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩causing to miscarry⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ to him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any ⸨fix:more⸩·ore⸨/fix⸩ death or barren ⸨i⸩land⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And he went up from thence unto Beth‑el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.⸨marg⸩
