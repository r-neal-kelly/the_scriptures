⸨size:0.85⸩⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ Jehoramʼs reign. ⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Mesha rebelleth. ⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Jehoram, with Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom, being distressed for want of water, by Elisha obtaineth water, and promise of victory. ⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ The Moabites, deceived by the colour of the water, coming to spoil, are overcome. ⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ The king of Moab, by sacrificing the king of Edomʼs son, raiseth the siege.⸨/i⸩⸨/size⸩

⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩Now⸨/sc⸩ Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And he wrought evil in the sight of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩image of Baal that his father had made.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩statue⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ But it came to pass, when ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 1⸼ 1⸼
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go ⸨fix:with⸩wit·⸨/fix⸩ me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ as thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩, my people as thy people, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ my horses as thy horses.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Kings ⸨fix:22⸼⸩·2⸼⸨/fix⸩ 4⸼
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ So the king of ⸨fix:Israel⸩Isra·l⸨/fix⸩ went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven daysʼ journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩that followed them.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩at their feet⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ But Jehoshaphat said, ⸨i⸩Is there⸨/i⸩ not here a prophet of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, that we may enquire of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ by him? And one of the king of Israelʼs servants answered and said, Here ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath called these three kings together, to ⸨fix:deliver⸩d·liver⸨/fix⸩ them into the hand of Moab.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And Elisha said, ⸨i⸩As⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came upon him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, Make this valley full of ditches.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ For thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And this is ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ a light thing in the sight of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩mar every good piece of land with stones.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩grieve⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And it ⸨fix:came⸩c·me⸨/fix⸩ to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩gathered all that were able to ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩were cried together⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩gird himself with a ⸨fix:girdle⸩·i·dle⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ red as blood:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And they said, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ blood: the kings are surely ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:destroyed⸩destroye·⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in ⸨i⸩their⸨/i⸩ country.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:they⸩the·⸨/fix⸩ smote in it even smiting⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees; ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩only in Kir‑haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, and smote it.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩until he ⸨fix:left⸩l·ft⸨/fix⸩ the stones thereof in ⸨fix:Kir‑haraseth⸩Kir‑h·ra ·eth⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that ⸨fix:drew⸩d·ew⸨/fix⸩ swords, to break through ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ unto the king of Edom: but they could not.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ Then he ⸨fix:took⸩too·⸨/fix⸩ his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and ⸨fix:offered⸩off·red⸨/fix⸩ him ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to ⸨i⸩their own⸨/i⸩ land.⸨marg⸩
