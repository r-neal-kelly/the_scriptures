⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And when the king asked the woman, she told him.

⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord?

⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And Hazael said, But what, ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath shewed me that thou ⸨i⸩shalt be⸨/i⸩ king over Syria.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ thou shouldest surely recover.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ in water, and spread ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.⸨marg⸩
