⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩In⸨/sc⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 Chr⸼ 32⸼ 24⸼⸨row⸩⸨fix:Isai⸼⸩I·ai⸼⸨/fix⸩ 38⸼ 1⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Give charge concerning thine house⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, saying,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ I beseech thee, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done ⸨i⸩that which is⸨/i⸩ good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩sore.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩with a great weeping⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩court, that the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came to him, saying,⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩city⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant Davidʼs sake.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ on the boil, and he recovered.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ the sign that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ the third day?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And Isaiah said, ⸨fix:This⸩Th·s⸨/fix⸩ sign shalt thou have of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩dial of Ahaz.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸩ ⸨/fix⸩Isai⸼ 38⸼ ⸨fix:8⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩Ecclus⸼ 48⸼ 23⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩degrees⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and ⸨i⸩all⸨/i⸩ the house of his ⸨sup⸩❙✝⸨/sup⸩armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩spicery⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩jewels⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩vessels⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ from Babylon.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All ⸨i⸩the things⸨/i⸩ that ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ Behold, the days come, that all that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸩ ⸨/fix⸩ch⸼ 24⸼ 13⸼⸨row⸩⸨fix:&⸩·⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:25⸼⸩2·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 13⸼⸨row⸩⸨fix:Jer⸼⸩·er⸼⸨/fix⸩ 27⸼ 19⸼
