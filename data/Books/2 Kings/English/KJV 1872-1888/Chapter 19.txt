⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And he sent Eliakim, which ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩blasphemy: ⸨fix:for⸩f·r⸨/fix⸩ the children are come to the birth, and ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ not strength to bring forth.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩provocation⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ It may be the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God will hear all the words of Rab‑shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up ⸨i⸩thy⸨/i⸩ prayer for the remnant that are ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩left.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩found⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say ⸨fix:to⸩t·⸨/fix⸩ your master, Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, Be not afraid of the words which ⸨fix:thou⸩th·u⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:hast⸩h·st⸨/fix⸩ heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have ⸨fix:blasphemed⸩blasph·med⸨/fix⸩ me.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Luke 3⸼ ⸨fix:4⸼⸩4⸨/fix⸩, called ⸨i⸩Esaias⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ So ⸨fix:Rab‑shakeh⸩R·b‑shakeh⸨/fix⸩ returned, and found the ⸨fix:king⸩k·ng⸨/fix⸩ of Assyria warring ⸨fix:against⸩ag·inst⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:Libnah⸩L·bna·⸨/fix⸩: for he had heard that he was departed from ⸨fix:Lachish⸩L·chish⸨/fix⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And when he heard ⸨fix:say⸩s·y⸨/fix⸩ of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against ⸨fix:thee⸩the·⸨/fix⸩: he sent messengers ⸨fix:again⸩a··in⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:unto⸩u·t·⸨/fix⸩ Hezekiah, saying,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest ⸨fix:deceive⸩d·ceive⸨/fix⸩ thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by ⸨fix:destroying⸩destr·ying⸨/fix⸩ them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have ⸨fix:destroyed⸩d·stroyed⸨/fix⸩; ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ in Thelasar?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Where ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and spread it before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And Hezekiah prayed before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and said, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of ⸨fix:Israel⸩Isr·el⸨/fix⸩, which dwellest ⸨i⸩between⸨/i⸩ the cherubims, thou art the ⸨fix:God⸩G·d⸨/fix⸩, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, bow down thine ⸨fix:ear⸩e·r⸨/fix⸩, and hear: open, ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ Of a truth, ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And have ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩cast their gods into the fire: for they ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ no gods, but the work of menʼs hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩given⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ thou only.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Israel, ⸨i⸩That⸨/i⸩ which thou ⸨fix:hast⸩h·st⸨/fix⸩ prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the word that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted ⸨i⸩thy⸨/i⸩ voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ against the Holy ⸨i⸩One⸨/i⸩ of Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩the tall cedar trees thereof, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, ⸨i⸩and into⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩the forest of his Carmel.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩By ⸨fix:the⸩·he⸨/fix⸩ hand of⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:the⸩th·⸨/fix⸩ tallness⸨/i⸩, &c⸼⸨row⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩the forest⸨/i⸩ and ⸨i⸩his fruitful field⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ I ⸨fix:have⸩ha·e⸨/fix⸩ digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩besieged places.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩fenced⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Hast ⸨fix:thou⸩th·u⸨/fix⸩ not heard long ago ⸨i⸩how⸨/i⸩ I have done it, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ of ⸨fix:ancient⸩ancie·t⸨/fix⸩ times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, ⸨fix:that⸩th·t⸨/fix⸩ thou shouldest be to lay ⸨fix:waste⸩w·ste⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:fenced⸩f··ced⸨/fix⸩ cities ⸨i⸩into⸨/i⸩ ruinous heaps.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩Hast thou not heard⸨/i⸩ how ⸨i⸩I have made it long ago⸨/i⸩, and ⸨i⸩formed it of ⸨fix:ancient⸩a·ci·nt⸨/fix⸩ times? should I now bring it to be laid waste⸨/i⸩, and ⸨i⸩fenced cities⸨/i⸩ to be ⸨i⸩ruinous ⸨fix:heaps⸩hea·s⸨/fix⸩?⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ Therefore their inhabitants were ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ the grass of the field, and ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ the green herb, ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ the grass on the house tops, and ⸨i⸩as corn⸨/i⸩ ⸨fix:blasted⸩b··sted⸨/fix⸩ before it ⸨fix:be⸩b·⸨/fix⸩ grown up.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩short of ⸨fix:hand⸩ha·d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And this ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ a sign unto thee, Ye ⸨fix:shall⸩sh·ll⸨/fix⸩ eat this year such things as grow of ⸨fix:themselves⸩·hemselves⸨/fix⸩, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and ⸨fix:bear⸩b··r⸨/fix⸩ fruit upward.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩the ⸨fix:escaping⸩esca·i·g⸨/fix⸩ of the house of Judah that ⸨fix:remaineth⸩remai·e·h⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ Therefore thus ⸨fix:saith⸩s··th⸨/fix⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a ⸨fix:bank⸩ban·⸨/fix⸩ against it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩35⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ it came to pass that night, that the angel of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ all dead corpses.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Is⸼⸩I·⸨/fix⸩ 37⸼ 36⸼⸨row⸩⸨fix:Tob⸼⸩To·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 1⸼ 21⸼⸨row⸩⸨fix:Ecclus⸼ 48⸼ 21⸼⸩Ecclus⸼ 48⸼ 21⸼ 1 Mac⸼ 7⸼ 41⸼⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩⸨fix:1 Mac⸼ 7⸼ 41⸼⸩⸨blank⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩2 Mac⸼ 8⸼ 19⸼
