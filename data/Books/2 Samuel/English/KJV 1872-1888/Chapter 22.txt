⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ I will call on the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, ⸨i⸩who is⸨/i⸩ worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ When the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩waves of death compassed me, the floods of ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ungodly men made me afraid;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩pangs⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Belial⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ The ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩cords⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ In my distress I called upon the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry ⸨i⸩did enter⸨/i⸩ into his ears.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ There went up a smoke ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩by⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ under his feet.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And he made darkness pavilions round about him, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩dark waters, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ thick clouds of the skies.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩binding of waters⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩many waters;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩great⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ He delivered me from my strong enemy, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was my stay.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ The ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ For I have kept the ways of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and have not wickedly departed from my God.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ For all his judgments ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ before me: and ⸨i⸩as for⸨/i⸩ his statutes, I did not depart from them.⸨marg⸩
