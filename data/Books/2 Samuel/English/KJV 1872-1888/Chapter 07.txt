⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in thine heart; for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass that night, that the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came unto Nathan, saying,⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Whereas I have not dwelt in ⸨i⸩any⸨/i⸩ house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ In all ⸨i⸩the places⸨/i⸩ wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chr⸼ 17⸼ 6⸼ ⸨i⸩any of the judges⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ of hosts, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ I took thee from the sheepcote, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Sam⸼ 16⸼ 12⸼⸨row⸩Ps⸼ 78⸼ 70⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩from after⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ⸨i⸩men⸨/i⸩ that ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ in the earth.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩from thy face⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And as since the time that I commanded judges ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ telleth thee that he will make thee an house.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ ¶ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Kin⸼ 8⸼ 20⸼
