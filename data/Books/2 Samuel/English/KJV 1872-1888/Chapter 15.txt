⸨size:0.85⸩⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ Absalom, by fair speeches and courtesies, stealeth the hearts of Israel. ⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ Under pretence of a vow he obtaineth leave to go to Hebron. ⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ He maketh there a great conspiracy. ⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ David upon the news fleeth from Jerusalem. ⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Ittai would not leave him. ⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ Zadok and Abiathar are sent back with the ark. ⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ David and his company go up mount Olivet weeping. ⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ He curseth Ahithophelʼs counsel. ⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ Hushai is sent back with instructions.⸨/i⸩⸨/size⸩

⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩, that when any man that had a controversy ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou? And he said, Thy servant ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ of one of the tribes of Israel.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩to come⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ good and right; but ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ no man ⸨i⸩deputed⸨/i⸩ of the king to hear thee.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩none will hear thee from the king⸨/i⸩ downward.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And it was ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩, that when any man came nigh ⸨i⸩to him⸨/i⸩ to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, in Hebron.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ¶ But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, ⸨i⸩that were⸨/i⸩ called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, Davidʼs counsellor from his city, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And David said unto all his servants that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not ⸨i⸩else⸨/i⸩ escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩thrust⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And the kingʼs servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants ⸨i⸩are ready to do⸨/i⸩ whatsoever my lord the king shall ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩appoint.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩choose⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And the king went forth, and all his household ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩after him. And the king left ten women, ⸨i⸩which were⸨/i⸩ concubines, to keep the house.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩at ⸨fix:his⸩·is⸨/fix⸩ feet⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the ⸨fix:Gittites⸩Gittite·⸨/fix⸩, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ a stranger, and also an exile.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ Whereas thou camest ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ yesterday, should I this day ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ with thee.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩make thee wander in going?⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And Ittai answered the king, and said, ⸨i⸩As⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ liveth, and ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ with him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Called, John 18⸼ ⸨fix:1⸼⸩1⸨/fix⸩, ⸨i⸩Cedron⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, he will bring me again, and shew me ⸨i⸩both⸨/i⸩ it, and his habitation:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, ⸨i⸩here am⸨/i⸩ I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ The king said also unto Zadok the priest, ⸨i⸩Art not⸨/i⸩ thou a ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Sam⸼ 9⸼ 9⸼
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And David went up by the ascent of ⸨i⸩mount⸨/i⸩ Olivet, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩going ⸨fix:up⸩u·⸨/fix⸩ and weeping⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨i⸩one⸨/i⸩ told David, saying, Ahithophel ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass, that ⸨i⸩when⸨/i⸩ David was come to the top ⸨i⸩of the mount⸨/i⸩, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩34⸨/sub⸩ But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ I ⸨i⸩have been⸨/i⸩ thy fatherʼs servant hitherto, so ⸨i⸩will⸨/i⸩ I now also ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩35⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨i⸩hast thou⸨/i⸩ not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the kingʼs house, thou shalt tell ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩36⸨/sub⸩ Behold, ⸨i⸩they have⸨/i⸩ there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadokʼs ⸨i⸩son⸨/i⸩, and Jonathan Abiatharʼs ⸨i⸩son⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩37⸨/sub⸩ So Hushai Davidʼs friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.⸨marg⸩
