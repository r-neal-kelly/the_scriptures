⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ The Spirit of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake by me, and his word ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in my tongue.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩He that ruleth over men ⸨i⸩must be⸨/i⸩ just, ruling in the fear of God.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩Be thou ruler⸨/i⸩, &c⸼
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨i⸩he shall be⸨/i⸩ as the light of the morning, ⸨i⸩when⸨/i⸩ the sun riseth, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ a morning without clouds; ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ the tender grass ⸨i⸩springing⸨/i⸩ out of the earth by clear shining after rain.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ Although my house ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all ⸨i⸩things⸨/i⸩, and sure: for ⸨i⸩this is⸨/i⸩ all my salvation, and all ⸨i⸩my⸨/i⸩ desire, although he make ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ not to grow.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ But ⸨i⸩the sons⸨/i⸩ of Belial ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ But the man ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ shall touch them must be ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the ⸨i⸩same⸨/i⸩ place.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩filled⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ These ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ the names of the mighty men whom David had: ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Adino the Eznite: ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩⸨i⸩he lift up his spear⸨/i⸩ against eight hundred, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩whom he slew at one time.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩Josheb‑bassebet the Tachmonite, head ⸨fix:of⸩o·⸨/fix⸩ the three⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ See 1 Chr⸼ 11⸼ 11⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:slain⸩·lain⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And after him ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, ⸨i⸩one⸨/i⸩ of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chr⸼ 11⸼ 12⸼
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And after him ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩·⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chr⸼ ⸨fix:11⸼⸩··⸼⸨/fix⸩ 27⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩for ⸨fix:foraging⸩·oraging⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ wrought a great victory.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩the three captains over the thirty⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And David ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ then ⸨i⸩in⸨/i⸩ Beth‑lehem.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth‑lehem, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ by the gate!⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth‑lehem, that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ by the gate, and took ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, and brought ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Be it far from me, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, that I should do this: ⸨i⸩is not this⸨/i⸩ the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three.

⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the ⸨i⸩first⸨/i⸩ three.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩who had done many acts, he slew two ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩great ⸨fix:of⸩o·⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:acts⸩·cts⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩lions of God⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And he slew an Egyptian, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptianʼs hand, and slew him with his own spear.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a man of countenance⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩sight: ⸨/i⸩called, 1 Chr⸼ 11⸼ ⸨fix:23⸼⸩23⸨/fix⸩, ⸨i⸩a man of⸨/i⸩ great ⸨i⸩stature⸨/i⸩.
