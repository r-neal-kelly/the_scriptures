⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩ it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And David said unto him, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩What was⸨/i⸩, &c⸼
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Here ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ I.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Behold me⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto me, Who ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou? And I answered him, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ an Amalekite.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩anguish is come upon me, because my life ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ yet whole in me.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩my coat of mail⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩my ⸨fix:embroidered⸩embroi·ered⸨/fix⸩ coat hindereth me, that my⸨/i⸩, &c⸼
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ upon his head, and the bracelet that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ Then David took hold on his clothes, and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ rent them; and likewise all the men that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ with him:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 3⸼ 31⸼⸨row⸩& 13⸼ 31⸼
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou? And he answered, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And David said unto him, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ anointed?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ps⸼ 105⸼ 15⸼
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And David said unto him, Thy blood ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ anointed.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah ⸨i⸩the use of⸨/i⸩ the bow: behold, ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ written ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ in the book ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩of Jasher.)⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Josh⸼ 10⸼ 13⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩of the upright⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ Ye mountains of Gilboa, ⸨i⸩let there be⸨/i⸩ no dew, neither ⸨i⸩let there be⸨/i⸩ rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, ⸨i⸩as though he had⸨/i⸩ not ⸨i⸩been⸨/i⸩ anointed with oil.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ Saul and Jonathan ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ lovely and ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩sweet⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.⸨marg⸩
