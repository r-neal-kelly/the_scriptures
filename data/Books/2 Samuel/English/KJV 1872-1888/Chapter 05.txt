⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said to thee, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ps⸼ 78⸼ 71⸼
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: and they anointed David king over Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ ¶ David ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ thirty years old when he began to reign, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ he reigned forty years.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ In Hebron he reigned over Judah ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 2⸼ 11⸼
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩thinking, ⸨fix:David⸩Dav·d⸨/fix⸩ cannot come in hither.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩saying, David shall ⸨fix:not⸩n·t⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩, &c⸼
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the city of David.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, ⸨i⸩that are⸨/i⸩ hated of Davidʼs soul, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨i⸩he shall be chief and captain⸨/i⸩. ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chr⸼ 11⸼ 6⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩Because ⸨fix:they⸩th·y⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:had⸩·ad⸨/fix⸩ said, even the blind and the ⸨fix:lame⸩lam·⸨/fix⸩, He shall not come into the house⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And David ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩went on, and grew great, and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of hosts ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ with him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩went, going and growing⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩f⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩masons: and they built David an house.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩f⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chr⸼ 14⸼ 1⸼⸨row⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩He·⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩hewers of ⸨fix:the⸩·he⸨/fix⸩ stone of the wall⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And David perceived that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israelʼs sake.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩g⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ David took ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩g⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chr⸼ 3⸼ 9⸼

⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ ¶ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:h⸩i⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard ⸨i⸩of it⸨/i⸩, and went down to the hold.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:h⸩i⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chr⸼ 11⸼ 16⸼⸨fix:⸩ & 14⸼ 8⸼⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩⸨fix:& 14⸼ 8⸼⸩⸨blank⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And David enquired of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And David came to ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:i⸩k⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Baal‑perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters.

⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And when David enquired of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, he said, Thou shalt not go up; ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.⸨marg⸩
