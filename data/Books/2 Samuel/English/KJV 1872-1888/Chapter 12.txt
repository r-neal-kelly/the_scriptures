⸨size:0.85⸩⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ Nathanʼs parable of the ewe lamb causeth David to be his own judge. ⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ David, reproved by Nathan, confesseth his sin, and is pardoned. ⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ David mourneth and prayeth for the child, while it lived. ⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ Solomon is born, and named Jedidiah. ⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ David taketh Rabbah, and tortureth the people thereof.⸨/i⸩⸨/size⸩

⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ The rich ⸨i⸩man⸨/i⸩ had exceeding many flocks and herds:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ But the poor ⸨i⸩man⸨/i⸩ had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩morsel⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor manʼs lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And Davidʼs anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, ⸨i⸩As⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ liveth, the man that hath done this ⸨i⸩thing⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩shall surely die:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨fix:is⸩i·⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩worthy to die⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And he shall restore the lamb ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ex⸼ 22⸼ 1⸼
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Nathan said to David, Thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ the man. Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Israel, I ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩·⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Sam⸼ 16⸼ 13⸼
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And I gave thee thy masterʼs house, and thy masterʼs wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if ⸨i⸩that had been⸨/i⸩ too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ take thy wives before thine eyes, and give ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Deut⸼⸩Deut⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:28⸼⸩··⸼⸨/fix⸩ 30⸼⸨fix:⸩ ch⸼ ·· 22⸼⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩⸨fix:& ch⸼ 16⸼ 22⸼⸩⸨blank⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ For thou didst ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩. And Nathan said unto David, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ The ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ecclus⸼ ⸨fix:47⸼⸩·7⸼⸨/fix⸩ 11⸼
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ to blaspheme, the child also ⸨i⸩that is⸨/i⸩ born unto thee shall surely die.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Nathan departed unto his house. And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ struck the child that Uriahʼs wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ David therefore besought God for the child; and David ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩fasted a fast⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And the elders of his house arose, ⸨i⸩and went⸨/i⸩ to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩do hurt⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed ⸨i⸩himself⸨/i⸩, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ Then said his servants unto him, What thing ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, ⸨i⸩while it was⸨/i⸩ alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell ⸨i⸩whether⸨/i⸩ ⸨sc⸩God⸨/sc⸩ will be gracious to me, that the child may live?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And David comforted Bath‑sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ she bare a son, and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ he called his name Solomon: and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ loved him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Matt⸼ 1⸼ 6⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chron⸼ 22⸼ ⸨fix:9⸼⸩9⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Jedidiah, because of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That is, ⸨i⸩Beloved of the ⸨fix:⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩⸩LORD⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩it be called after my name.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩my name be called upon it⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:g⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ And he took their kingʼs crown from off his head, the weight whereof ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was ⸨i⸩set⸨/i⸩ on Davidʼs head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩in great abundance.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:g⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chron⸼ 20⸼ 2⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩very great⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ And he brought forth the people that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ therein, and put ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.⸨marg⸩
