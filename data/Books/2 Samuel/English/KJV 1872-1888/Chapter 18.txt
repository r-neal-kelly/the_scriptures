⸨size:0.85⸩⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ David viewing the armies in their march giveth them charge of Absalom. ⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ The Israelites are sore smitten in the wood of Ephraim. ⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ Absalom, hanging in an oak, is slain by Joab, and cast into a pit. ⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ Absalomʼs place. ⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Ahimaaz and Cushi bring tidings to David. ⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ David mourneth for Absalom.⸨/i⸩⸨/size⸩

⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ David numbered the people that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joabʼs brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now ⸨i⸩thou art⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩worth ten thousand of us: therefore now ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ better that thou ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩succour us out of the city.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩set⸨/i⸩ ⸨fix:their⸩t··ir⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩heart ⸨fix:on⸩o·⸨/fix⸩ us⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:as⸩a·⸨/fix⸩ ten ⸨fix:thousand⸩th··sand⸨/fix⸩ of ⸨fix:us⸩··⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:be⸩··⸨/fix⸩ to ⸨fix:succour⸩succo··⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ⸨i⸩Deal⸨/i⸩ gently for my sake with the young man, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand ⸨i⸩men⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩multiplied to devour⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ under him went away.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And a certain man saw ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten ⸨i⸩shekels⸨/i⸩ of silver, and a girdle.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And the man said unto Joab, Though I should ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩receive a thousand ⸨i⸩shekels⸨/i⸩ of silver in mine hand, ⸨i⸩yet⸨/i⸩ would I not put forth mine hand against the kingʼs son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Beware that none ⸨i⸩touch⸨/i⸩ the young man Absalom.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩weigh upon mine hand⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Beware whosoever⸨/i⸩ ye be ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩, &c⸼
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against ⸨i⸩me⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ yet alive in the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩midst of the oak.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩before thee⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩heart⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And ten young men that bare Joabʼs armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit ⸨fix:in⸩·n⸨/fix⸩ the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ the kingʼs dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalomʼs place.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Gen⸼ ⸨fix:14⸼⸩1·⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:17⸼⸩17⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩avenged him of his enemies.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩judged him from the hand⸨/i⸩, &c⸼
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the kingʼs son is dead.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩be a man of tidings⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ready?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩be what⸨/i⸩ may.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩convenient?⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ But howsoever, ⸨i⸩said he⸨/i⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩, ⸨/i⸩⸩, ⸨/fix⸩let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ alone, ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold ⸨i⸩another⸨/i⸩ man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ And the watchman said, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a good man, and cometh with good tidings.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩I see the running⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, ⸨sup⸩❙✝⸨/sup⸩All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God, which hath ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:Peace⸩P····⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩ be to ⸨fix:thee⸩the·⸨/fix⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Peace⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩shut up⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And the king said, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the kingʼs servant, and ⸨i⸩me⸨/i⸩ thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what ⸨i⸩it was⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ Is there ⸨i⸩peace⸨fix:?⸩ ·⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ And the king said ⸨i⸩unto him⸨/i⸩, Turn aside, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Tidings, my lord the king: for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:Tidings⸩Tidin·s⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:is⸩·⸨/fix⸩ brought⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ And the king said unto Cushi, ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do ⸨i⸩thee⸨/i⸩ hurt, be as ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ young man ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!⸨marg⸩
