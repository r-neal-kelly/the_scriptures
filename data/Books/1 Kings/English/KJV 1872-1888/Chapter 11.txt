⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ his God, as ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the heart of David his father.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ For Solomon went after ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩⸨/sup⸩ Judg⸼ 2⸼ 13⸼
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And Solomon did evil in the sight of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩went not fully after the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, as ⸨i⸩did⸨/i⸩ David his father.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩fulfilled not after⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Israel, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ which had appeared unto him twice,⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 3⸼ ⸨fix:5⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩& 9⸼ 2⸼
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ commanded.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ ⸨fix:6⸼⸩6⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:12⸼⸩1·⸼⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ Wherefore the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:is⸩i·⸨/fix⸩ with ⸨fix:thee⸩t···⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:ch⸼⸩ch⸨/fix⸩ 12⸼ 15⸼

⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ will give one tribe to thy son for David my servantʼs sake, and for Jerusalemʼs sake which I have chosen.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ of the kingʼs seed in Edom.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:g⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:g⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 Sam⸼ 8⸼ 14⸼
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his fatherʼs servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad ⸨i⸩being⸨/i⸩ yet a little child.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the ⸨fix:queen⸩·ueen⸨/fix⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaohʼs house: and Genubath was in Pharaohʼs household among the sons of Pharaoh.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩He·⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:Send⸩S·n·⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:me⸩··⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:away⸩awa·⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩He·⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:Not⸩N·t⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And God stirred him up ⸨i⸩another⸨/i⸩ adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:h⸩f⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ when David slew them ⸨i⸩of Zobah⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:h⸩f⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:2⸩·⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:Sam⸼⸩S··⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:8⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 3⸼⸨row⸩& 10⸼ ⸨fix:18⸼⸩··⸼⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad ⸨i⸩did⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:i⸩g⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomonʼs servant, whose motherʼs name ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ hand against the king.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:i⸩g⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 Chr⸼ 13⸼ 6⸼
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ And this ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the cause that he lifted up ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩closed⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And the man Jeroboam ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩was industrious, he made him ruler over all the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩charge of the house ⸨fix:of⸩o·⸨/fix⸩ Joseph.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩did work⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:burden⸩bu·den⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ alone in the field:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ And Ahijah caught the new garment that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ on him, and rent it ⸨i⸩in⸨/i⸩ twelve pieces:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ (But he shall have on tribe for my servant Davidʼs sake, and for Jerusalemʼs sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do ⸨i⸩that which is⸨/i⸩ right in mine eyes, and ⸨i⸩to keep⸨/i⸩ my statutes and my judgments, as ⸨i⸩did⸨/i⸩ David his father.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩34⸨/sub⸩ Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servantʼs sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩35⸨/sub⸩ But ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:k⸩h⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ I will take the kingdom out of his sonʼs hand, and will give it unto thee, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ ten tribes.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:k⸩h⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 12⸼ 15⸼
⸨sub⸩36⸨/sub⸩ And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:lamp⸩lam·⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:candle⸩can·le⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩37⸨/sub⸩ And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩38⸨/sub⸩ And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do ⸨i⸩that is⸨/i⸩ right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩39⸨/sub⸩ And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩40⸨/sub⸩ Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩41⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the rest of the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩words⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩things⸨/i⸩.
