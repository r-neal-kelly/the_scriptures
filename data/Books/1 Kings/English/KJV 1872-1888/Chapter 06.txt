⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ it came to pass [in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt], in the fourth year of Solomonʼs reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the second month, that he ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩began to build the house of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 Chr⸼ ⸨fix:3⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 1⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩built⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And the house which king Solomon built for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, the length thereof ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty ⸨i⸩cubits⸨/i⸩, and the height thereof thirty cubits.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ ten cubits ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the breadth thereof before the house.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And for the house he made ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩windows of narrow lights.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩windows broad⸨/i⸩ within, and ⸨i⸩narrow⸨/i⸩ without: or, ⸨i⸩skewed⸨/i⸩ and ⸨i⸩closed⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩against the wall of the house he built ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩chambers round about, ⸨i⸩against⸨/i⸩ the walls of the house round about, ⸨i⸩both⸨/i⸩ of the temple and of the oracle: and he made ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩chambers round about:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩upon⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩joining to⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:floors⸩·loors⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩ribs⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ The nethermost chamber ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ five cubits broad, and the middle ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ six cubits broad, and the third ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ seven cubits broad: for without ⸨i⸩in the wall⸨/i⸩ of the house he made ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩narrowed rests round about, that ⸨i⸩the beams⸨/i⸩ should not be fastened in the walls of the house.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩narrowings⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩rebatements⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor ax ⸨i⸩nor⸨/i⸩ any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ The door for the middle chamber ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in the right ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle ⸨i⸩chamber⸨/i⸩, and out of the middle into the third.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩He·⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:shoulder⸩shou··er⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩with beams and boards of cedar.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ ⸩ ⸨/fix⸩Or, ⸨i⸩the ⸨fix:vaultbeams⸩·ault·eams⸨/fix⸩ and ⸨fix:the⸩he⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:cielings⸩cielngs⸨/fix⸩ with ⸨fix:cedar⸩edar⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨i⸩then⸨/i⸩ he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came to Solomon, saying,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩Concerning⸨/i⸩ this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ which I spake unto David thy father:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 Sam⸼ 7⸼ 13⸼⸨row⸩1 Chr⸼ 22⸼ 10⸼
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ So Solomon built the house, and finished it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ he covered ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩from the ⸨fix:floor⸩·loor⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:of⸩o·⸨/fix⸩ the house unto the walls⸨/i⸩, &c⸼ and so ver⸼ 16⸼
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ for it within, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ for the oracle, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ for the most holy ⸨i⸩place⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And the house, that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩, the temple before it, was forty cubits ⸨i⸩long⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And the cedar of the house within ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ carved with ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩knops and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩open flowers: all ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ cedar; there was no stone seen.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:gourds⸩·ourds⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:openings⸩ope·ings⸨/fix⸩ of flowers⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And the oracle in the forepart ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩pure gold; and ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩ covered the altar ⸨i⸩which was of⸨/i⸩ cedar.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:shut⸩·hut⸨/fix⸩ up⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ by the oracle he overlaid with gold.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And within the oracle he made two cherubims ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙✝⸨/sup⸩olive tree, ⸨i⸩each⸨/i⸩ ten cubits high.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩oily⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩trees of oil⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And five cubits ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the ⸨fix:cherub⸩ch·rub⸨/fix⸩: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ ten cubits.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And the other cherub ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ten cubits: both the cherubims ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ of one measure and one size.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ The height of the one cherub ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ten cubits, and so ⸨i⸩was it⸨/i⸩ of the other cherub.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the ⸨i⸩one⸨/i⸩ wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ex⸼ 25⸼ ⸨fix:20⸼⸩·0⸼⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩the cherubims stretched forth their ⸨fix:wings⸩··ngs⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩open flowers, within and without.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:openings⸩open····⸨/fix⸩ of ⸨fix:flowers⸩f·····⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And for the entering of the oracle he made doors ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ olive tree: the lintel ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ side posts ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩a fifth part ⸨i⸩of the wall⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:fivesquare⸩f···sq····⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ The ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩two doors also ⸨i⸩were of⸨/i⸩ olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩open flowers, and overlaid ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:leaves⸩lea···⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:of⸩··⸨/fix⸩ the ⸨fix:doors⸩·····⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩H··⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:openings⸩open···⸨/fix⸩ of ⸨fix:flowers⸩f·····⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ So also made he for the door of the temple posts ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ olive tree, ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩a fourth part ⸨i⸩of the wall⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ ⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨fix:Or⸩·r⸨/fix⸩, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:foursquare⸩four·are⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩34⸨/sub⸩ And the two doors ⸨i⸩were of⸨/i⸩ fir tree: the two leaves of the one door ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ folding, and the two leaves of the other door ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ folding.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩35⸨/sub⸩ And he carved ⸨i⸩thereon⸨/i⸩ cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ with gold fitted upon the carved work.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩36⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩37⸨/sub⸩ ¶ In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ laid, in the month Zif:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩38⸨/sub⸩ And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the eighth month, was the house finished ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it.
