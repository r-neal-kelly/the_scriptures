⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do ⸨i⸩to me⸨/i⸩, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And when he saw ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer‑sheba, which ⸨i⸩belongeth⸨/i⸩ to Judah, and left his servant there.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ ¶ But he himself went a dayʼs journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, take away my life; for I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ not better than my fathers.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩for his life⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ eat.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And he looked, and, behold, ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩bolster⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩came⸨/i⸩ to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And he said, I have been very jealous for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ I, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Rom⸼⸩R··⸨/fix⸩⸨fix: 11⸼ ⸩ ⸨/fix⸩3⸼
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩. And, behold, the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ not in the earthquake:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And after the earthquake a fire; ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And it was ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩, when Elijah heard ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, ⸨i⸩there came⸨/i⸩ a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And he said, I have been very jealous for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ king over Syria:⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and ⸨i⸩then⸨/i⸩ I will follow thee. And he said unto him, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Go back again: for what have I done to thee?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Go ⸨fix:return⸩re·urn⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
