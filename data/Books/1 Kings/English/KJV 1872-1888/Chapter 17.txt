⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came unto him, saying,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide ⸨fix:thyself⸩t·yself⸨/fix⸩ by the brook Cherith, that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ before Jordan.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And it shall be, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ So he went and did according unto the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ before Jordan.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩at the end of days⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came unto him, saying,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ Arise, get thee to ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Zarephath, which ⸨i⸩belongeth⸨/i⸩ to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Luke 4⸼ ⸨fix:26⸼⸩26⸨/fix⸩, called ⸨i⸩Sarepta⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And as she was going to fetch ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And she said, ⸨i⸩As⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ For thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩sendeth rain upon the earth.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩giveth⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩And⸨/i⸩ the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, which he spake ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩by Elijah.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩by the hand of⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass after these things, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And he cried unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and said, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And he ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and said, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ my God, I pray thee, let this childʼs soul come ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩into him again.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩measured⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩into his inward parts⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ a man of God, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ that the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ in thy mouth ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ truth.⸨marg⸩
