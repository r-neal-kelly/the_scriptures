⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ his God, as the heart of David his father.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Nevertheless for Davidʼs sake did the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ his God give him a ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩candle⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ Because David did ⸨i⸩that which was⸨/i⸩ right in the eyes of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and turned not aside from any ⸨i⸩thing⸨/i⸩ that he commanded him all the days of his life, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 Sam⸼ 11⸼ 4⸼⸨row⸩& 12⸼ 9⸼
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And Asa did ⸨i⸩that which was⸨/i⸩ right in the eyes of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, as ⸨i⸩did⸨/i⸩ David his father.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asaʼs heart was perfect with the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ all his days.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And he brought in the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, silver, and gold, and vessels.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩holy⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ Then Asa took all the silver and the gold ⸨i⸩that were⸨/i⸩ left in the treasures of the house of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and the treasures of the kingʼs house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ben‑hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:2⸩·⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:Chr⸼⸩C·r⸼⸨/fix⸩ 16⸼ ⸨fix:2⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩

⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ So Ben‑hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel‑beth‑maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, when Baasha heard ⸨i⸩thereof⸨/i⸩, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩free⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:g⸩f⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:g⸩f⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Matt⸼ 1⸼ ⸨fix:8⸼⸩8⸨/fix⸩, called ⸨i⸩Josaphat⸨/i⸩.
