⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ That the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ appeared to Solomon the second time, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ ⸨fix:3⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:5⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ ⸨fix:8⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:29⸼⸩··⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩f⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ 2 Sam⸼ ⸨fix:7⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 12⸼⸨row⸩⸨fix:1 ⸩ ⸨/fix⸩Chr⸼ 22⸼ ⸨fix:10⸼⸩·0⸼⸨/fix⸩

⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩g⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩g⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Jer⸼ 7⸼ 14⸼
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And at this house, ⸨i⸩which⸨/i⸩ is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩h⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Why hath the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ done thus unto this land, and to this house?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:f⸩h⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Deut⸼ 29⸼ 24⸼⸨row⸩Jer⸼ 22⸼ 8⸼
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And they shall answer, Because they forsook the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ brought upon them all this evil.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:g⸩i⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and the kingʼs house,⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:g⸩i⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 Chr⸼ 8⸼ 1⸼

⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩For⸨/i⸩ Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ a present unto his daughter, Solomonʼs wife.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and he burnt incense ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩upon the altar that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
