⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And Solomon told her all her ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩questions: there was not ⸨i⸩any⸨/i⸩ thing hid from the king, which he told her not.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:words⸩·ords⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomonʼs wisdom, and the house that he had built,⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ Blessed be the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, ⸨fix:to⸩t·⸨/fix⸩ do judgment and justice.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great ⸨fix:store⸩·tore⸨/fix⸩, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And the king made of the almug trees ⸨sup⸩❙✝⸨/sup⸩pillars for the house of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and for the kingʼs house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩rails⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a prop⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 Chr⸼ 9⸼ 10⸼
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ which Solomon gave her ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩of his royal bounty.

⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨i⸩he made⸨/i⸩ three hundred shields ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ house of the forest of Lebanon.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩·⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ ⸨fix:7⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 2⸼

⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ round ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩behind: and ⸨i⸩there were⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩on ⸨fix:the⸩he⸨/fix⸩ hinder ⸨fix:part⸩·art⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:thereof⸩there·f⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:hands⸩·ands⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And all king Solomonʼs drinking vessels ⸨i⸩were of⸨/i⸩ gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon ⸨i⸩were of⸨/i⸩ pure gold; ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩none ⸨i⸩were of⸨/i⸩ silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, there was ⸨i⸩no silver⸨/i⸩ in them.
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ivory, and apes, and peacocks.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩elephantsʼ teeth⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And all the earth ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩sought the ⸨fix:face⸩·ace⸨/fix⸩ of⸨/i⸩.
