⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩appoint: for thou knowest that ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩say⸨/i⸩.
