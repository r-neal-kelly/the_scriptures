⸨in⸩⸨i⸩Lamentations⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.—⸩—⸨/fix⸩The Book of Lamentations consists of five elegies, each of them, except the last, composed of verses commencing with consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
⸨in⸩There is a heading to the Book in the Greek and Latin versions, which does not exist in the Hebrew. As this heading is omitted in our text, we give it here:—⸨lang:Greek⸩Καὶ ἐγενετο μετὰ τὸ αἰχμαλωτισθῆναι τὸν Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐρημωθῆναι ἐκάθισεν Ἱερεμίας κλαίων, καὶ ἐθρήνησε τὸν θρῆνον τοῦτον ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ εἶπεν⸨/lang⸩. “And it came to pass, after Israel was taken captive and Jerusalem was made a desolation, Jeremiah sat weeping and uttered this lamentation over Jerusalem, and said.”
⸨in⸩Hereupon follows chapter i⸼, which consists of twenty‑two verses, the number of letters of the Hebrew alphabet, all arranged in order. The second chapter also consists of twenty‑two verses, but in the Hebrew the letters ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פ⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ע⸨/lang⸩ (verses 16, 17) are transposed; ver⸼ 16 of the Hebrew commences thus: ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פָּצוּ עָלַיִךְ פִּיהֶם⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, ver⸼ 17, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עָשָׂה יְהֹוָה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩. Strangely enough, the Greek copies mark these ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ע⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פ⸨/lang⸩: Tisch⸼, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἄϊν⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Greek⸩Φή⸨/lang⸩; Bagster, ⸨lang:Greek⸩ΑΙΝ⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Greek⸩ΦΗ⸨/lang⸩. The French has adopted this error. The same transposition of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ע⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פ⸨/lang⸩ occurs at chapters ii⸼, iii⸼ and iv⸼, and in every instance the Greek and the French reproduce the same error. The Latin is correctly marked, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Phe⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Ain⸨/lang⸩.
⸨in⸩Chap⸼ iii⸼ consists of twenty‑two triplets, each triplet beginning with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Here the grouping of the verses in Tischendorf and in our Codex is very incorrect. Under ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩א⸨/lang⸩, or ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἄλεφ⸨/lang⸩, there are four verses, one of which belongs to ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ב⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Βήθ⸨/lang⸩; under ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ב⸨/lang⸩ there are three verses, one of which belongs to ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ג⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Γίμελ⸨/lang⸩; the third belonging to ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ג⸨/lang⸩ is grouped with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ד⸨/lang⸩. Ver⸼ 12, which begins with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ד⸨/lang⸩, is marked ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ה⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἤ⸨/lang⸩; ver⸼ 15 begins with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ה⸨/lang⸩, but is grouped with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ו⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Οὐαῦ⸨/lang⸩. The letter ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ט⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Τήθ⸨/lang⸩, is marked twice, once at ver⸼ 25 and again at ver⸼ 27. Ver⸼ 28, which begins with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩י⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἰωδ⸨/lang⸩, is grouped with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ט⸨/lang⸩. Ver⸼ 29 is omitted entirely, thus spoiling the triplet. This verse we have supplied from the Codex Compl⸼: ⸨lang:Greek⸩θήσει ἐν κονιορτῷ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ εἴποτε ᾖ ἐλπίς⸨/lang⸩. Ver⸼ 30, which commences with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩י⸨/lang⸩, is grouped with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩כ⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Κάφ⸨/lang⸩. From this point the confusion increases; no fewer than five verses are grouped under ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ל⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Λάμεδ⸨/lang⸩, two of which commence with the following letter ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מ⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Μὴμ⸨/lang⸩. The verses beginning with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נ⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Νοὺν⸨/lang⸩, are correctly grouped. The verses commencing with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ס⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Σάμεχ⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ע⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἄϊν⸨/lang⸩, and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פ⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Φή⸨/lang⸩, are strangely jumbled: ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ע⸨/lang⸩ is placed in the middle of a verse which belongs to ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ס⸨/lang⸩; vv⸼ 47, 48 (46, 47 Tisch⸼) are grouped under ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ע⸨/lang⸩ instead of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פ⸨/lang⸩. Verses 49, 50, 51 (48, 49, 50 Tisch⸼), which should come under ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ע⸨/lang⸩, are grouped under ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פ⸨/lang⸩. The verses under ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩צ⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ק⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ר⸨/lang⸩ are correctly grouped, but ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שׁ⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Χσέν⸨/lang⸩, encroaches upon ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ת⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Θαῦ⸨/lang⸩. In the Hexaglot Bible these verses will be found properly grouped in threes and arranged in order of the Hebrew text.
⸨in⸩We cannot tell upon what principles modern critics proceed, or by what rules they are guided in furnishing us with a superior Greek text of the Old Testament, but we should naturally expect that the principles and rules would be identical with those which regulate the criticism of the New Testament. Those who have the opportunity and the privilege of obtaining access to the various manuscripts, and of weighing the evidence for and against particular passages of the New Testament, ⸨i⸩e⸼g⸼⸨/i⸩, Matt⸼ vi⸼ 13; xviii⸼ 11; xxiv⸼ 36, and many others of considerable moment, do not scruple to reject those passages, valued as they may have been, against which there is an overpowering weight of evidence. But while the original Greek of the New Testament is thus freely and fearlessly criticised, the translation of the Old Testament appears to be handled with such fear and trembling by the same critics, that they would rather reproduce errors and glosses like those which we have more than once pointed out, mistakes proceeding from the ignorance or negligence of former transcribers, than violate the reading of a favourite codex. What we want in both Testaments and in every language is as pure a copy of the Word of God as we can obtain.
⸨in⸩There is one more remark we have to make before leaving this Book, viz⸼, that the omission of chap⸼ iii⸼ 29 is denoted in most Greek copies by the verses being numbered 28, 30; Tischendorf has numbered the verses straight on, 28, 29. We think that this is a step in the wrong direction; to ignore or to conceal a palpable omission like this, is hardly consistent with sound biblical criticism.
