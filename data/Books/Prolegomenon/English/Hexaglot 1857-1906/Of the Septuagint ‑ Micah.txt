⸨in⸩Micah v⸼ 2. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Καὶ σὺ Βηθλεὲμ οἶκος Ἐφραθά, ὀλιγοστὸς εἴ, κ⸼τ⸼λ⸼⸨/lang⸩ This agrees with the Hebrew, but St⸼ Matthew has, chap⸼ ii⸼ 6, ⸨lang:Greek⸩οὐδαμῶς ἐλαχίστη εἶ⸨/lang⸩, apparently a direct contradiction to the words of the Prophet, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩צָעִיר לִהְיֹות בְּאַלְפֵי יְהוּדָה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩. Hence some have inferred that the text has been corrupted in this place. We have no doubt that this inference has proceeded from a misconception of the Hebrew idiom. For under the positive ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩צָעִיר⸨/lang⸩ there is implied a very strong negative. Bethlehem, smallest in size, fewest in number, was yet by no means the least in quality and in honour among the thousands of Judah; and why? because from thence the Saviour was to come.
