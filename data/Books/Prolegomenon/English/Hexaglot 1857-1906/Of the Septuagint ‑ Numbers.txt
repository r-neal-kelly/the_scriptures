⸨in⸩Numbers xi⸼ 15. One of the ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩תקון ספרים⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, corrections of the Scribes, “Let me not see ⸨i⸩my⸨/i⸩ wretchedness.” It is said that the original reading was, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩בְּרָעָתְךָ⸨/lang⸩, “⸨i⸩thy⸨/i⸩ wretchedness.” This is doubtful, for all the versions agree with the present Hebrew text.
⸨in⸩Num⸼ xii⸼ 12. “Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his motherʼs womb.” It is affirmed that ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אִמֹּו⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩בְּשָׂרֹו⸨/lang⸩ have been substituted for ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אִמֵּנוּ⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩בְּשָׂרֵנוּ⸨/lang⸩. But the Greek and all the versions agree with the Hebrew text as we now have it.
⸨in⸩Numbers xxiv⸼ 7. The Greek, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἐξελεύσεται ἄνθρωπος ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ, καὶ κυριεύσει ἐθνῶν πολλῶν⸨/lang⸩, “A man shall come forth from his seed, and shall rule over many nations,” is said to be a paraphrase of the Hebrew, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩יִזַּל־מַיִם מִדָּלְיָו וְזַרְעֹו בְּמַיִם רַבִּים⸨err:⸩׃⸨/err⸩⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩. Is it not more probable that the Greek translation was made from a copy containing a different reading, something like this: ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩יִזַּל אִישׁ מִזַּרְעֹו וְיִגְדַּל בְּעַמִּים רַבִּים⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩⸨err:? ⸩. ⸨/err⸩We are aware that there is not much similarity in the words ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מים⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩איש⸨/lang⸩, as they appear here; but in Rabbinical there is a very close resemblance between ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עיס⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩קים⸨/lang⸩. ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩⸨err:מִדָּלְיָו⸩מדָּלְיָו⸨/err⸩⸨/lang⸩ is an incorrect form.
⸨in⸩Numbers xxxv⸼ 2⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩5. It is remarkable that the word ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מִגְרָשׁ⸨/lang⸩ is rendered in the Septuagint by four different words in four consecutive verses; ver⸼ 2, ⸨lang:Greek⸩τὰ προαστεια⸨/lang⸩; ver⸼ 3, ⸨lang:Greek⸩τὰ ἀφορίσματα⸨/lang⸩; ver⸼ 4, ⸨lang:Greek⸩τὰ συγκυροῦντα⸨/lang⸩; ver⸼ 5, ⸨lang:Greek⸩τὰ ὅμορα⸨/lang⸩. The Vulgate has “⸨lang:Latin⸩suburbana⸨/lang⸩”; English, “suburbs”; German, “⸨lang:German⸩Vorſtädte⸨/lang⸩”; French, “⸨lang:French⸩territoires⸨/lang⸩.” In addition to this obvious defect in the rendering of the Septuagint, it is manifest that the passage is corrupt. At ver⸼ 4, we read, “And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, ⸨i⸩shall reach⸨/i⸩ from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.” Instead of a thousand cubits, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אֶלֶף אַמָּה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, the Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩δισχιλίους πήχας⸨/lang⸩, two thousand cubits. This matter has been well explained by Dr⸼ Owen, in “An Enquiry into the Present State of the Septuagint” (London, 1769). He says, “The fourth verse may be considered as a geometrical problem, whereby the Jews are required to circumscribe a space, reaching from the wall of the city outwards, a thousand cubits round about.
⸨in⸩“The fifth verse contains the solution of this problem … . Let us draw the figure according to the directions given, and see whether the problem is not thereby actually solved:—

⸨in⸩“Let ⸨sc⸩a b c d⸨/sc⸩ represent the city, standing in the midst, and not to be estimated in the mensuration. Then, says the text, measure on the east side (⸨sc⸩b c⸨/sc⸩) 2000 cubits. That is, draw the line ⸨sc⸩k g⸨/sc⸩, viz⸼, ⸨sc⸩k b⸨/sc⸩ + ⸨sc⸩c g⸨/sc⸩ = 2000 cubits. Draw, likewise, on the south side (⸨sc⸩d c⸨/sc⸩) the line ⸨sc⸩e d⸨/sc⸩ + ⸨sc⸩c h⸨/sc⸩ = 2000 cubits. In the same manner, draw on the west side (⸨sc⸩a d⸨/sc⸩) the line ⸨sc⸩l f⸨/sc⸩, viz⸼, ⸨sc⸩l a⸨/sc⸩ + ⸨sc⸩d f⸨/sc⸩ = 2000 cubits, and on the north side (⸨sc⸩a b⸨/sc⸩) the line ⸨sc⸩m i⸨/sc⸩, viz⸼, ⸨sc⸩m a⸨/sc⸩ + ⸨sc⸩b i⸨/sc⸩ = 2000 cubits. Through the extremities of these lines draw the periphery ⸨sc⸩e f g h i k l m⸨/sc⸩, and it will circumscribe a space reaching from the wall of the city outwards just a thousand cubits round about, that is, every way; ⸨err:Q⸼E⸼F⸼⸩Q⸼ E⸼ F⸼⸨/err⸩ Corollary: Hence, then, it necessarily follows that the Septuagint reading is false; for to make the space from the wall outwards two thousand cubits round about, the measure on the sides must needs be four thousand cubits.”
