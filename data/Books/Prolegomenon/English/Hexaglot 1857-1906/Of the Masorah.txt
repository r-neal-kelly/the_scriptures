⸨cen⸩OF THE MASORAH.

⸨in⸩The word Masorah, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מָסֹורָה⸨/lang⸩, signifies tradition; and the Masorah is an elaborate collection of notes made from Hebrew manuscripts and commentaries, by Jewish doctors of the school of Tiberias, during and after the sixth century. These notes refer principally to irregularities of consonants, vowels and accents in the Hebrew text. At one time they were of such magnitude, that they formed a volume greater than the text itself, “⸨lang:Latin⸩In tantam molem excrescebant ut Textum Biblicum superarent⸨/lang⸩” (Walton). The greater part of the Masoretic notes have perished. The Masorah consisted of two parts, the Textual and the Final. The notes of the Textual were introduced into the margin, and were abridged to save space; hence arose the ⸨lang:Latin⸩Masorah Parva⸨/lang⸩. Subsequently these notes were given in a fuller form above, below and at the side of the text; hence arose the ⸨lang:Latin⸩Masorah Magna⸨/lang⸩. The omissions placed at the end of the volume received the name of ⸨lang:Latin⸩Masorah Finalis⸨/lang⸩. In modern editions of the Hebrew Bible the textual Masoretic notes, including the ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩קְרִי⸨/lang⸩ (read) and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩כְּתִיב⸨/lang⸩ (written) are usually placed at the foot of the page. This was found unsuitable to the plan of the Hexaglot Bible, and therefore the notes have been affixed at the end of each volume of the Old Testament. As to the notes themselves very few of them are of any importance.
