⸨cen⸩OF HEBREW MANUSCRIPTS.

⸨in⸩Of Hebrew manuscripts there are two classes in existence: the rolled manuscripts which are used in the Synagogues, and the square used by private individuals. All of these are apographs or copies, the autographs having long perished. A specimen of the Synagogue rolls may be found amongst the Harleian manuscripts in the British Museum. The most ancient Hebrew manuscripts were written without division of words; hence arose the Rabbinical tradition that the Law was one verse and one word. Modern printed editions follow the recensions of Ben Asher, Cent⸼ XI⸼ The first division into chapters was made by Hugo de Sancto Victore, about ⸨err:⸨sc⸩a⸼d⸼⸨/sc⸩⸩⸨sc⸩a⸼ d⸼⸨/sc⸩⸨/err⸩ 1250. The scarcity of Hebrew manuscripts and their comparatively modern date is thus accounted for by Bishop Walton: “After the general reception of the critical edition of the Masorites and their method of punctuation, the Jewish masters condemned all manuscripts not conforming to these as profane and illegitimate. The manuscripts were consequently destroyed.” Owing to this monstrous act, if indeed it were ever perpetrated, there are few Hebrew manuscripts in existence more than 500 or 600 years old, whereas the Greek manuscripts, ⸨err:⸨i⸩e⸼g⸼⸨/i⸩⸩⸨i⸩e⸼ g⸼⸨/i⸩⸨/err⸩, the Vatican and the Alexandrian, are at least 🄂200 years old. Since Kennicottʼs edition there are known to be extant nearly 700 Hebrew manuscripts. Those which are most in repute among the Jews are the Codex Hillelis, or the Spanish, ⸨sc⸩a⸼d⸼⸨/sc⸩ 1200; the Codex Ben Asher, followed by the Palestinians; the Codex Ben Naphtali, followed by the Babylonians; about ⸨sc⸩a⸼d⸼⸨/sc⸩ 1034. In addition to these is the Codex Sinai, which is a revision of the Pentateuch and a treatise on the accents; and, finally, the Jericho Pentateuch, which treats of words redundant and defective.
⸨in⸩It would far exceed the proposed limits of this Prolegomenon, to mention all the editions of the Hebrew Bible that have appeared at various epochs. We shall content ourselves with mentioning a few of the principal editions, especially those which have led to the present received Hebrew text.
⸨in⸩The oldest edition of the whole Hebrew Bible is that of Abraham Ben Chaim, printed at Soncino, 1488. Next in order is that of Gerson, son of Rabbi Moses, Brescia, 1494. The first edition of Daniel Bomberg was printed by him, and edited by Felix Pratensis, Venice, 1518. The second edition of Daniel Bomberg was printed by him, and edited by Jacob Ben Chaim, Venice, 1525⸨err:–⸩‑⸨/err⸩6. The first Hebrew Bible printed in Germany was Sebastian Munsterʼs, Basle, 1534. Buxtorfʼs great Bible was published at the same place, 1618⸨err:–⸩‑⸨/err⸩20.
⸨in⸩The edition of Joseph Athias, Amsterdam, 1671⸨err:–⸩‑⸨/err⸩7, is worthy of special notice, not only on account of its intrinsic merit, but because on this is founded the celebrated edition of Van Der Hooght, Amsterdam, 1705; an edition which has been followed by Hahn, Leipsic, 1831, and by nearly all modern editors. Athias reprinted and revised the text of Jacob Ben Chaim, and as a token of approbation the States General of Holland conferred on him a gold chain and medal.
⸨in⸩The modern Hebrew text then may be thus traced back: Hahn, 1831; Van Der Hooght, 1705; Athias, 1661; Bomberg, 1525; Ben Asher, Cent⸼ XI⸼
⸨in⸩The editors of the Hexaglot Bible have used the text of Van der Hooght; they have moreover consulted the editions of the learned Letteris (⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ספר הקדש והוא תורה נביאים וכתובים הוגה ונערך על ידי מ׳ ה׳ לעטעריס׃ וויען תרי״ב⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩⸨err:; ⸩ ⸨/err⸩Vienna, 1852. Two vols⸼ 8vo⸼); and of Luzzatto (⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חמשה חומשי תורה עם הפטרות⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, ⸨lang:Italian⸩Il Pentateucho colle Haftarót volgarizzato … da S⸼ D⸼ Luzzatto⸨/lang⸩; Trieste, 1858⸨err:–⸩‑⸨/err⸩61. Five vols⸼ 8vo⸼). Many inaccuracies pointed out by these critics as having crept into the accents of modern editions have been carefully corrected.
