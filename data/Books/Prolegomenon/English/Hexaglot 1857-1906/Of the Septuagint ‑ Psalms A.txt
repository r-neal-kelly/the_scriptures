⸨in⸩⸨i⸩The Psalms⸨/i⸩. The first point, to which we have to invite attention, is the different division of the Psalms in the Hebrew and the Greek.
⸨in⸩The difference commences at Psalm x⸼ of the Hebrew, which forms part of Ps⸼ ix⸼ of the Greek. After this, Psalm xi⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩cxiii⸼ of the Hebrew⸨err: ⸩, ⸨/err⸩= Psalm x⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩cxii⸼ Greek. Psalms cxiv⸼, cxv⸼ Hebrew = Psalm cxiii⸼ Greek. Psalm cxvi⸼ Hebrew⸨err: ⸩, ⸨/err⸩= Psalm cxiv⸼, cxv⸼ Greek. Psalm cxvii⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩⸨err:cxlvi⸼ = cxvi⸼⸩cxlvi⸼=cxvi⸼⸨/err⸩⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩cxlv⸼ Psalm cxlvii⸼ = cxlvi⸼, cxlvii⸼
⸨in⸩The Greek division is wrong, for Psalm ix⸼ was obviously one of the alphabetical Psalms, consisting of twenty‑two verses; although we have it now in an imperfect state. We have made the Greek uniform with the Hebrew and the other versions. Again, in many instances, the heading of a Psalm, to which, it appears, the Jews have attached considerable importance, is numbered verse 1 in the Hebrew, and in a few instances verses 1, 2; not so in the versions. Hence arises a discrepancy in the numbering of ⸨i⸩the verses⸨/i⸩ of many of the Psalms. The Hebrew will appear to have an extra verse in Psalm iii⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩ix⸼, xii⸼, xiii⸼, xviii⸼, xix⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩xxii⸼, xxx⸼, xxxi⸼, xxxiv⸼, xxxvi⸼, xxxviii⸼, xlii⸼, xliv⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩xlix⸼, li⸼, lii⸼ (2 verses) liii⸼, liv⸼, (2 verses) lv⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩lix⸼, lx⸼ (2 verses) lxi⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩lxv⸼, lxvii⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩lxx⸼, lxxv⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩lxxvii⸼, lxxx⸼, lxxxi⸼, lxxxiii⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩lxxxv⸼, lxxxviii⸼, lxxxix⸼, xcii⸼⸨err:, ⸩ ⸨/err⸩cviii⸼, cxx⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩cxxxiv⸼, cxli⸼, cxlii⸼ In every instance, however, it will be found, that, though differently numbered, the verses at the end of the several columns of the Hexaglot Bible correspond.
⸨in⸩The titles to the Psalms are deserving of special notice, as they have presented no trifling difficulty in the way of Biblical students; and it is hoped, that the annexed list of titles, as they appear in the various languages, will furnish an illustration, both, of the facility of comparison afforded by the arrangement of the texts of the Hexaglot Bible, and of the advantage which the comparison itself secures from the light which one language reflects upon the other.
⸨in⸩Six of the Psalms bear the title of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מִכְתָּם⸨/lang⸩ viz⸼, xvi⸼, lvi⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩lx⸼ The Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩Στηλογραφία⸨/lang⸩, “an inscription on a pillar;” Latin, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Tituli inscriptio⸨/lang⸩. Gesenius says that ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מִכְתָּם⸨/lang⸩ is the same as ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מִכְתָּב⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩something written⸨/i⸩. Dr⸼ Tregelles calls this ⸨i⸩a very bold conjecture⸨/i⸩. But Gesenius is borne out by the Greek and Latin versions. Luther alone derives ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩⸨err:מִכְתָּם⸩מִכתָּם⸨/err⸩⸨/lang⸩ from ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩כֶּתֶם⸨/lang⸩ gold; for he has ⸨lang:German⸩ein gülden Kleinod⸨/lang⸩. The English and French throw no light upon the title. If ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מִכְתָּם⸨/lang⸩ be not here employed in the sense of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מִכְתָּב⸨/lang⸩, to which conclusion the old Greek and Latin versions would lead the modern student; then we must be permitted to make another, and perhaps bolder conjecture, viz⸼, that the Greek translator had before him a text containing a different reading, probably the correct one, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מִכְתָּב⸨/lang⸩, and that the ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ב⸨/lang⸩ was subsequently converted into ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ם⸨/lang⸩ by ignorant or careless transcribers. We cannot agree with Horneʼs suggestion, borrowed from DʼHerbelot, that the six Psalms which bear the title of “Michtam,” or ⸨i⸩golden⸨/i⸩, are so called on account of their having been, on some occasion or other, written in letters of gold, and hung up in the sanctuary.
⸨in⸩Forty‑five of the Psalms are entitled ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מִזְמֹור⸨/lang⸩, Song or Poem, viz⸼ iii⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩vi⸼, viii⸼, ix⸼, xii⸼, xiii⸼, xv⸼, xix⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩xxiv⸼, xxix⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩xxxi⸼, xxxvii⸼, xxxix⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩xli⸼, xlvii⸼, xlix⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩li⸼, lxii⸼, lxiv⸼, lxxiii⸼, lxxv⸼, lxxvii⸼, lxxix⸼, lxxx⸼, lxxxii⸼, lxxxiv⸼, lxxxv⸼, xcviii⸼, c⸼, ci⸼, cix⸼, cx⸼, cxxxix⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩cxlii⸼
⸨in⸩Psalm xlvi⸼ is entitled ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שִׁיר⸨/lang⸩, “A song,” rendered in all the versions as the equivalent of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מִזְמֹור⸨/lang⸩.
⸨in⸩Seven Psalms bear the title ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מִזְמֹור ⸨err:שִׁיר⸩שׁיר⸨/err⸩⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, viz⸼, xxx⸼, lxv⸼, lxvii⸼, lxviii⸼, lxxv⸼, lxxvi⸼, xcii⸼ ⸨lang:Greek⸩ψαλμὸς ᾠδή⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Psalmus cantici⸨/lang⸩; ⸨lang:German⸩Ein Pſalmlied⸨/lang⸩, appear to us to express the real meaning, viz⸼, a Psalm to be sung, or a Poem set to music. The English, “A Psalm ⸨i⸩or⸨/i⸩ Song,” and the French “⸨lang:French⸩Psaume ⸨i⸩ou⸨/i⸩ Cantique⸨/lang⸩” are clearly incorrect.
⸨in⸩Five Psalms are entitled ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שִׁיר מִזְמֹור⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, “A song adapted to poetry,” or, as Gesenius well expresses it, “adapted to rhythmical numbers.” These are Psalms xlviii⸼, lxvi⸼, lxxxiii⸼, lxxxviii⸼, cviii⸼ The Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ὠδὴ ψαλμοῦ⸨/lang⸩, the ode or subject of the song; the term ⸨lang:Greek⸩ὠδὴ⸨/lang⸩ clearly referring to the ⸨i⸩words⸨/i⸩ of the Psalm which follows. The English and French renderings, Song ⸨i⸩or⸨/i⸩ Psalm, ⸨lang:French⸩Cantique ⸨i⸩ou⸨/i⸩ Psaume⸨/lang⸩, would require the addition of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אֹו⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩or⸨/i⸩, in the original; moreover, if the expressions be synonymous, one of them must be superfluous throughout the book.
⸨in⸩Four Psalms have the title of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩תְּפִלָּה⸨/lang⸩ (Tʼphillah) ⸨lang:Greek⸩Προσευχή⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Oratio⸨/lang⸩, Prayer, ⸨lang:German⸩Gebet⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:French⸩Prière⸨/lang⸩; viz⸼, xvii⸼, lxxxvi⸼, xc⸼, cii⸼ Properly speaking, these are not ⸨lang:Greek⸩ψαλμοί⸨/lang⸩, they are ⸨lang:Greek⸩προσευχαί⸨/lang⸩. The whole, however, come under the general appellation of ⸨lang:Greek⸩ψαλμοί⸨/lang⸩, which term itself is borrowed from the Hebrew ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩סֵפֶר תְּהִלִּים⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩ (Sepher Tʼhillim), the name given to the entire book, and said to be taken from Psalm cxlv⸼, a magnificent Psalm, and the only one which bears the title ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩תְּהִלָּה⸨/lang⸩ ⸨i⸩praise⸨/i⸩.
⸨in⸩Fifteen of the Psalms cxx⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩cxxxiv⸼, bear the title of ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שִׁיר הַמַּעֲלֹות⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩ (Shir Hammaghaloth). Upon this title, the versions ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ὠδὴ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Canticum graduum⸨/lang⸩, A song of degrees, ⸨lang:German⸩Ein Lied im höhern Chor⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:French⸩Cantique de Mahaloth⸨/lang⸩ throw very little light. Horne says, “These Psalms are supposed to have derived this name from their being sung, when the people came up, either to worship in Jerusalem at the annual festivals, or from the Babylonish captivity. The Jews went up to Jerusalem, which, it will be recollected, stood on a steep, rocky ascent, in large companies, after the oriental manner, and perhaps beguiled their way by singing these Psalms. For such an occasion, Jahn remarks, the appellation of ‘ascensions’ was singularly adapted, as the inhabitants of the east, when speaking of a journey to the metropolis of their country, delight to use the word ⸨i⸩ascent⸨/i⸩.” Gesenius argues, that this supposition is far from the truth, inasmuch as the ascent to Jerusalem is mentioned in two only out of the fifteen Psalms (cxxii⸼, cxxvi⸼) To refute the hypothesis that they were sung by the Israelites on their return from exile, he refers to Ezra vii⸼ 9, from whence it appears that the ascent occupied no less than four months. We assume in this instance, that the silence of Tregelles implies consent to Geseniusʼs view, and with his view we fully concur. These Psalms are so called, says Gesenius, “because of the metre and rhythm found in them; the sense goes on progressively; the first or the last words of a preceding sentence are often repeated at the beginning of those that follow.” As illustrations he cites Psalms cxxi⸼ and cxxiv⸼ We are certainly disposed to think that Psalm cxxi⸼ may be properly called a Song of degrees, because it rises from step to step, until it reaches a climax. A man in deep distress cries, “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help, my help from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.” The reply follows: “He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; He will keep thee, preserve thee (⸨i⸩⸨err:i⸼e⸼⸩i⸼ e⸼⸨/err⸩⸨/i⸩ thy body); preserve thy soul, preserve them both for evermore.” This is the climax.
⸨in⸩Twelve Psalms bear the title of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מַשְׂכִּיל⸨/lang⸩ (root ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שָׂכַל⸨/lang⸩), xxxii⸼, xlii⸼, xliv⸼, lii⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩lv⸼, lxxiv⸼, lxxviii⸼, lxxxviii⸼, lxxxix⸼, cxlii⸼ Gesenius considers the easiest explanation of this term to be ⸨i⸩a didactic poem⸨/i⸩. The LXX⸼ render the word by ⸨lang:Greek⸩Σύνεσις⸨/lang⸩; Latin, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Intellectus⸨/lang⸩; German, ⸨lang:German⸩Eine Unterweiſung⸨/lang⸩. These combined give us a clue to the true sense. The ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מַשְׂכִּיל⸨/lang⸩ is something that makes wise, is understood, taught. What is that? We have the answer in the Greek ⸨lang:Greek⸩⸨err:σύνεσις⸩συνεσις⸨/err⸩⸨/lang⸩, from ⸨lang:Greek⸩συνίημι⸨/lang⸩, the first meaning of which is, “to put together.” Thus ⸨lang:Greek⸩σύνεσις⸨/lang⸩ is a putting together, or ⸨i⸩a composition⸨/i⸩. This word will make sense in every case. The English and French, Maschil or ⸨lang:French⸩Maskil⸨/lang⸩, throw no light upon the subject.
⸨in⸩Ten of the Psalms are entitled ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הַלְלוּיָהּ⸨/lang⸩ cvi⸼, cxi⸼, cxii⸼, cxiii⸼, cxxxv⸼, cxlvi⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩cl⸼ In these instances, the English and French follow the Hebrew, by making the title part of verse 1.
⸨in⸩The word ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לַמְנַצֵּחַ⸨/lang⸩ is used before ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לְדָוִד⸨/lang⸩ alone in twenty‑six cases; Psalms xi⸼, xiii⸼, xiv⸼, xviii⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩xxi⸼, xxxi⸼, xxxvi⸼, xl⸼, xli⸼, xlii⸼, xliv⸼, xlvii⸼, xlix⸼, li⸼, lii⸼, lxiv⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩lxvi⸼, lxviii⸼, lxx⸼, lxxxv⸼, cix⸼, cxxxix⸼, cxl⸼
⸨in⸩As to the meaning of the term, it is difficult to decide. The Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩Εἰς τὸ τέλος⸨/lang⸩; Latin, ⸨lang:Latin⸩In finem⸨/lang⸩; English, To the Chief‑Musician; French, ⸨lang:French⸩Au Maître‑chantre⸨/lang⸩. Gesenius says that the opinion of Kimchi, Rashi and Aben Ezra is the best which has been advanced, viz⸼, ⸨i⸩To the precentor⸨/i⸩. This is highly probable, for it explains ⸨lang:Greek⸩εἰς τὸ τέλος⸨/lang⸩, in the sense of ⸨i⸩to the authority⸨/i⸩, as that of a ⸨i⸩superintendent⸨/i⸩; although it must be confessed the Latin expression “⸨lang:Latin⸩In finem⸨/lang⸩,” looks a little like a misconception of the Greek ⸨lang:Greek⸩τέλος⸨/lang⸩. The English and French are correct according to this view. Luther has ⸨lang:German⸩vorzuſingen⸨/lang⸩, evidently taking the word ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מְנַצֵּחַ⸨/lang⸩ as the Syriac form of the Infinitive. Gesenius thinks that this is excluded by the article implied after the prefix. This exclusion, however, depends upon the acceptance or the rejection of the vowel‑points as they now stand.
⸨in⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לַמִנַצֵּחַ⸨/lang⸩ is used: 1⸼—Before ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩בִּנְגִינֹות⸨/lang⸩ in six instances; viz⸼, Psalm iv⸼, vi⸼, liv⸼, lv⸼, lxvii⸼, lxxvi⸼; once also before ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עַל נְגִינֹות⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, Psalm lxi⸼ The Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἐν ὕμνοις⸨/lang⸩; Latin, ⸨lang:Latin⸩In hymnis⸨/lang⸩; the German has, ⸨lang:German⸩Auf Saitenſpielen⸨/lang⸩, On stringed instruments; and this is probably the meaning.
⸨in⸩2⸼—Once before ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אֶל־הַנְּחִילֹות⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, Ps⸼ v⸼ This is an ambiguous term. Gesenius conjectures that ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נְחִילָה⸨/lang⸩ is for ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נְחִלָּה⸨/lang⸩, from ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חָלַל⸨/lang⸩ ⸨i⸩to bore⸨/i⸩, and suggests “a pipe or flute,” because perforated. This is far‑fetched. The Greek, Latin and German agree in treating the word as a derivative from ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נָחַל⸨/lang⸩ ⸨i⸩to receive as an inheritance⸨/i⸩. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ὑπὲρ τῆς κληρονομούσης⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Pro ea quæ hereditatem consequitur⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:German⸩Für das Erbe⸨/lang⸩. Lutherʼs ⸨i⸩for the inheritance⸨/i⸩ is the most intelligible. As usual the English throws no light upon the title. But here, as in many other instances, the French has “⸨lang:French⸩Psaume de David, ⸨i⸩envoyé⸨/i⸩ au Maître‑chantre ⸨i⸩pour être chanté⸨/i⸩ sur Nehiloth⸨/lang⸩.” This certainly makes the title in general a little clearer than the English.
⸨in⸩3⸼—Three times before ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עַל הַגִּתִּית⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, viii⸼, lxxxi⸼, lxxxiv⸼ Gesenius says, “A kind of musical instrument, either used by the people of Gath, or as it were ⸨lang:Greek⸩ἐπιλήνιον⸨/lang⸩, as used in the vintage with the songs of the wine‑dressers and press‑treaders.” The Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩⸨err:Ὑπὲρ⸩Ὑπερ⸨/err⸩ τῶν ληνῶν⸨/lang⸩; the Latin, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Pro torcularibus⸨/lang⸩, “For the vintage, the wine‑press.” We have no doubt that any one who will take the trouble to read the three Psalms which bear this title, will concur with us in the view that these convey the true meaning; ⸨err:viz⸼⸩viz⸨/err⸩, To the precentor, a song of praise of David for the vintage, or the blessings of Providence in general. We would just suggest, that as ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לְדָוִד⸨/lang⸩ Psalm viii⸼, and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לְאָסָף⸨/lang⸩ Psalm lxxxi⸼, are rendered in the English version, ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ David, ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ Asaph, so ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לִבְנֵי־קֹרַח⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩ Psalm lxxxiv⸼, should be rendered ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩, not ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩, the sons of Korah.
⸨in⸩4⸼—Three times before ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עַל־שֹׁושַׁנִּים⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, xlv⸼, lxix⸼, lxxx⸼ Gesenius explains this to be an instrument of music resembling a lily. Mr⸼ Harmer and others doubt this, and suggest that “the lily” is the title of the Psalm. The Greek and Latin furnish us with a very different idea, inasmuch as they associate the word with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שָׁנָה⸨/lang⸩ “to change.” ⸨lang:Greek⸩⸨err:Ὑπὲρ⸩Ὑπερ⸨/err⸩ τῶν ἀλλοιωθησομένων⸨/lang⸩; Latin, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Pro iis qui commutabuntur⸨/lang⸩. Luther has ⸨lang:German⸩⸨err:Von⸩Vor⸨/err⸩ den Roſen⸨/lang⸩. The English rendering is unintelligible. Perhaps the meaning is, To the Precentor, a composition of the sons of Korah, a nuptial‑song (⸨lang:German⸩ein Brautlied⸨/lang⸩) ⸨i⸩to be accompanied (⸨lang:French⸩pour être chanté⸨/lang⸩) ⸨/i⸩on the ⸨i⸩instrument called⸨/i⸩ the Shoshannim.
⸨in⸩⸨err:5⸼⸩⸼⸨/err⸩—Once before ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עַל־מַחֲלַת⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩ Psalm liii⸼ Here the Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩⸨err:ὑπὲρ⸩ὑπερ⸨/err⸩ ⸨err:μαελὲθ⸩μαελέθ⸨/err⸩⸨/lang⸩, Latin, ⸨lang:Latin⸩pro Maeleth⸨/lang⸩; English and French, Mahalath. But the question is, what does ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מַחֲלַת⸨/lang⸩ mean? Gesenius says, ⸨i⸩a harp⸨/i⸩; others say, ⸨i⸩a ⸨err:dance⸩aance⸨/err⸩⸨/i⸩; Luther has ⸨lang:German⸩im Chor um einander vorzuſingen⸨/lang⸩. Possibly the meaning is, To the Precentor, a composition of David ⸨i⸩to be accompanied⸨/i⸩ on the harp, or (according to Luther), to be sung antiphonally.
⸨in⸩6⸼⸨err:—⸩_⸨/err⸩Once before ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עַל־עֲלָמֹות⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩ Psalm xlvi⸼ Here the Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩ὑπὲρ τῶν κρυφίων⸨/lang⸩, as if from ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עָלַם⸨/lang⸩ to conceal; Latin, ⸨lang:Latin⸩pro arcanis⸨/lang⸩, “about hidden things.” The German has ⸨lang:German⸩von der Jugend⸨/lang⸩, “of youth,” as if the abstract substantive of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עֶלֶם⸨/lang⸩. The sense seems to be, To the Precentor, a song of the sons of Korah, about the hidden things, viz⸼, of God.
⸨in⸩7⸼—Once before ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עַל־מוּת לַבֵּן⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, Ps⸼ ix⸼ Here we meet with a very perplexing title. Tregelles says: “Some take ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לַבֵּן⸨/lang⸩ as a name of one of Davidʼs enemies, others regard ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ל⸨/lang⸩ as servile, and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩בֵּן⸨/lang⸩ as the proper name of a Levite, as in 1 Chron⸼ xv⸼ 18.” (But in this case the pointing should be ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לְבֵן⸨/lang⸩.) “Some moderns suppose ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מוּת לַבֵּן⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩ to be the name of a musical instrument. Better read ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עַלמוּת לַבֵּן⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩.” So far we agree; but as to the rendering, ⸨i⸩With virginsʼ voice for the boys, to be sung by them⸨/i⸩, to us it appears sheer nonsense. The Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩ὑπὲρ τῶν κρυφίων τοῦ υἱοῦ⸨/lang⸩; the Latin, ⸨lang:Latin⸩pro occultis filii⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩about the hidden things of the son⸨/i⸩⸨err:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/err⸩evidently reading ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עלמות⸨/lang⸩ as from ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עָלַם⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩to hide⸨/i⸩, and supplying ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עַל⸨/lang⸩. Thus the sense would be, To the Precentor, on the hidden things of the Son, a Psalm of David.
⸨in⸩8⸼—Twice before ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הַשְּׁמִינִית⸨/lang⸩, Ps⸼ vi⸼, xii⸼ There seems to be no doubt that this was an instrument with eight strings.
⸨in⸩9⸼—Twice before ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עַל יְדוּתוּן⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, Ps⸼ lxii⸼ 1, lxxvii⸼ 1; once before ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לִידוּתוּן⸨/lang⸩, Ps⸼ xxix⸼ 1. The Greek, Latin and German treat this as a proper name. Gesenius says, “Proper name of a Levite set by David as chief over a choir.”
⸨in⸩Twenty‑six Psalms have no title in Hebrew: i⸼, ii⸼, x⸼, xxiv⸼, xxxiii⸼, xliii⸼, lxxi⸼, xci⸼, xcii⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩xcix⸼, civ⸼, cv⸼, cvii⸼, ⸨err:cxiv⸼⸩civ⸼⸨/err⸩⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩⸨err:cxix⸼⸩cix⸼⸨/err⸩, cxxxvi⸼, cxxxvii⸼ The Talmud calls these Orphan Psalms. Some of them, however, have titles in the Greek and Latin, viz⸼, Psalm lxxi⸼, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Τῷ Δαυίδ, υἱῶν Ἰωναδὰβ καὶ τῶν πρώτων αἰχμαλωτισθέντων⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Psalmus David filiorum Jonadab et priorum captivorum⸨/lang⸩; “A Psalm of David, of the sons of Jonadab and the first captives.” Ps⸼ ⸨err:xciii⸼⸩xciii⸨/err⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Εἰς τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ προσαββάτου, ὅτε κατῷκισται ἡ γῆ, αἶνος ᾠδῆς τῷ Δαυίδ⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Laus Cantici ipsi David in die ante sabbatum, quando fundata est terra⸨/lang⸩; “A Hymn of praise of David, on the day before the Sabbath when the world was founded.” Ps⸼ xcix⸼, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυίδ⸨/lang⸩; ⸨lang:Latin⸩Psalmus ipsi David⸨/lang⸩. Ps⸼ cv⸼, cvii⸼, cxiv⸼, cxvi⸼⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩cxix⸼, cxx⸼, cxxxvi⸼, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἀλληλούια⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Alleluia⸨/lang⸩. Ps⸼ cxxxvii⸼, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Τῷ Δαυὶδ Ἱερεμίου⸨/lang⸩; ⸨lang:Latin⸩Psalmus David Jeremiæ⸨/lang⸩. Thus the Greek and Latin translators have supplied or restored thirteen out of the twenty‑six titles to the Hebrew “Orphan Psalms.”
⸨in⸩To the Hebrew titles of Psalms cxxxviii⸼, cxlvii⸼, and cxlviii⸼, the Greek adds, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἀγγαίου καὶ Ζαχαρίου⸨/lang⸩. Ps⸼ cxlii⸼, the Greek adds, ⸨lang:Greek⸩ὅτε αὐτὸν ὁ υἱὸς κατεδιώκει⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩when his son was persecuting him⸨/i⸩⸨err:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/err⸩to which the Latin adds, ⸨lang:Latin⸩⸨i⸩Absalom⸨/i⸩⸨/lang⸩. Ps⸼ cxliv⸼, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לְדָוִד⸨/lang⸩; the Greek and Latin add, ⸨lang:Greek⸩πρὸς τὸν Γολιὰδ⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩adversus Goliath⸨/lang⸩. Ps⸼ cxlvi⸼, the Greek and Latin add, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἀγγαίου καὶ Ζαχαρίου⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Aggæi et Zachariæ⸨/lang⸩. So much for the titles to the Psalms.
⸨in⸩Eight of the Psalms are arranged in alphabetical order, the order being now more or less complete. These are Psalms ix⸼, xxv⸼, xxxiv⸼, xxxvii⸼, cxi⸼, cxii⸼, cxix⸼, and cxlv⸼
⸨in⸩Of Psalm ix⸼, every clause of verses 2, 3 commences with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩א⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 4 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ב⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 6 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ג⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 7 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ה⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 8⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩11 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ו⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 12 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ז⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 14 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ח⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 16 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ט⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 18 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩י⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 19 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩כ⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 13 again with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩כ⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 15 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ל⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 17 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נ⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 20 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ק⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 21 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שׁ⸨/lang⸩. The acrostic, if it may be so called, is imperfect.
⸨in⸩Of Psalm xxv⸼ the letter ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ב⸨/lang⸩ is hidden in ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩בְּךָ⸨/lang⸩, after ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אֱלֹהַי⸨/lang⸩ ver⸼ 2; ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ו⸨/lang⸩ is found in the middle of ver⸼ 5, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ר⸨/lang⸩ takes the place of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ק⸨/lang⸩ ver⸼ 18, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פ⸨/lang⸩ is affixed at the end, and, if we may form an opinion from the context, is an interpolation.
⸨in⸩Ps⸼ xxxiv⸼ is regular, except that ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ו⸨/lang⸩ is found in the middle of ver⸼ 5, and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פ⸨/lang⸩ is again subjoined.
⸨in⸩Ps⸼ xxxvii⸼ Every ⸨i⸩alternate⸨/i⸩ verse begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet, as far as ver⸼ 27. At ver⸼ 29 ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩א⸨/lang⸩ takes the place of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ע⸨/lang⸩; then ver⸼ 30 begins with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פ⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 32 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩צ⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 34 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ק⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 35 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ר⸨/lang⸩, ver⸼ 37 with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ש⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ת⸨/lang⸩ is concealed behind ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ו⸨/lang⸩ at ver⸼ 39.
⸨in⸩Psalms cxi⸼ and cxii⸼ are antiphonal; each verse consists of two clauses, each clause commencing with a consecutive letter of the alphabet; but the last two verses consist of three clauses each. In these there is no irregularity.
⸨in⸩Ps⸼ cxix⸼, as is well known, contains 176 verses, ⸨i⸩i⸼e⸼⸨/i⸩, 8 times 22, the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet; the first eight verses begin with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩א⸨/lang⸩, the second with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ב⸨/lang⸩, and so on without any interruption.
⸨in⸩The last of the alphabetical Psalms is cxlv⸼; this is perfect also with the exception of one verse, viz⸼, ver⸼ 14, which should commence with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נ⸨/lang⸩. Curiously enough, this verse is actually found in the Septuagint: ⸨lang:Greek⸩Πιστὸς Κύριος ἐν τοῖς λόγοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὅσιος ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ⸨/lang⸩. The Hebrew of this is obviously: ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נֶאֱמָן יְהֹוָה בִדְבָרָיו וְרָחוּם בְּכָל־מַעֲשָׂיו⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩. “The Lord is faithful in his words, and merciful in all his works.” That this or a similar versicle was in existence when the Septuagint translation was made, is highly probable. It is now wanting in the Hebrew.
⸨in⸩Finally, there is Ps⸼ cli⸼, which, as it finds a place in the text of Tischendorf, and we have taken the liberty to reject, we feel bound to insert here:—

⸨in⸩⸨i⸩Translation⸨/i⸩. “This Psalm was written by David himself, although beyond the number, when he fought in single combat with Goliath.
⸨in⸩“I was little amongst my brethren, and very young in the house of my father; I used to keep my fatherʼs sheep; my hands made an organ, and my fingers fitted up a psaltery, and who shall tell my lord? The Lord himself, he heareth. He sent his angel, and took me from my fatherʼs sheep, and anointed me with the oil of his anointing. My brethren were fair and great, yet the Lord did not take pleasure in them. I went out to meet the Philistine, and he cursed me by his idols. But I, having unsheathed his sword, beheaded him, and took away the reproach from the children of Israel.”
⸨in⸩This does not read like one of the Psalms of David; but yet it is found in the Syriac, Arabic and Ethiopic versions, as well as in the Septuagint.
