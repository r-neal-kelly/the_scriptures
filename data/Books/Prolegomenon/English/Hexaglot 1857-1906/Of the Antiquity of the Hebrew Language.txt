⸨cen⸩OF THE ANTIQUITY OF THE HEBREW LANGUAGE.

⸨in⸩According to Bishop Walton and others, the word Hebrew is derived from the verb ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עָבַר⸨/lang⸩, to pass over, because Abram passed over the river Euphrates into the land of Canaan. Others are of opinion that the word is derived from the proper name ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עֵבֶר⸨/lang⸩, Heber, the progenitor of Abram. Whatever be the derivation of the word ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עִבְרִי⸨/lang⸩, the antiquity of the language is very great. Into this question Walton enters at considerable length in his Prolegomenon. He proves the antiquity of the Hebrew language by the names of men and places from the creation to the dispersion at Babel. Thus man is called ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אָדָם⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩Adam⸨/i⸩, because⸨err: he was ⸩ ⸨/err⸩taken from the ground, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אֲדָמָה⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩adama⸨/i⸩. The first woman is called Eve, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חַוָּה⸨/lang⸩, because she is the mother of all living, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חַיָּה⸨/lang⸩. Peleg, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פֶּלֶג⸨/lang⸩, is so called because in his days the earth was divided, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נִפְלְגָה⸨/lang⸩. In these and similar instances the connection between the proper name and the event from which it takes its origin is obvious. It is desirable, however, that the biblical student should not confound historical narration with grammatical derivation. Adam was so called because he was taken from the ground; yet the derivation of the word ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אָדָם⸨/lang⸩ is not ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אֲדָמָה⸨/lang⸩, but some monosyllable, probably either ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אֵד⸨/lang⸩, a vapour, or ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩דָּם⸨/lang⸩, blood. In like manner ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חַוָּה⸨/lang⸩ is derived from ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חַי⸨/lang⸩, not from ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חַיָּה⸨/lang⸩. We draw attention to this subject because, singularly enough, the learned Bishop Walton himself falls more than once into the error of confusing history with etymology. Speaking of Noah, he observes: “⸨lang:Latin⸩Noachus, ⸨/lang⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נֹחַ⸨/lang⸩⸨lang:Latin⸩ consolator, a verbo ⸨/lang⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נָחַם⸨/lang⸩⸨lang:Latin⸩, abjecto ⸨/lang⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מ⸨/lang⸩⸨lang:Latin⸩, quia dixit Lamechus, consolabitur nos ab opere nostro⸨/lang⸩.” The connection between the words ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נֹחַ⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נָחַם⸨/lang⸩ is clear, but it is equally clear that the former is the root, not the latter. The sacred historian no more affirms, at Gen⸼ v⸼ 29, that ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נֹחַ⸨/lang⸩ is derived from ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נָחַם⸨/lang⸩, than he affirms, at chapter iv⸼ 1, that ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩קַיִן⸨/lang⸩ is derived from ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩קָנִיתִי⸨/lang⸩, or, at chapter x⸼ 25, that ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩פֶּלֶג⸨/lang⸩ is derived from ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נִפְלְגָה⸨/lang⸩. In spite of this oversight of the venerable Bishop, his main argument as to the antiquity of the Hebrew language must be admitted to have great force. In addition to the names of individuals, he adduces the names of nations and peoples as having some significance in Hebrew, none in other languages, ⸨err:⸨i⸩e⸼g⸼⸨/i⸩⸩⸨i⸩e g⸼⸨/i⸩⸨/err⸩, Assyrian from Assur, Elamite from Elam, Aramæan from Aram, Lydian from Lud, Mede from Madai, Ionian from Javan. He further adduces the names of heathen gods in support of this antiquity⸨err:. ⸩ ⸨/err⸩He asserts, “⸨lang:Latin⸩Japetum filium Cœli et Terræ, patrem Atlantis⸨/lang⸩,” to have been no other than Japhet, son of Noah. Saturn, so called because when he fled from Jupiter, he hid himself at Latium, is associated with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩סָתַר⸨/lang⸩, to hide; Jove with the sacred name ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩יְהֹוָה⸨/lang⸩; Belus with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩בַּעַל⸨/lang⸩, Vulcan with ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩תּוּבַל קַיִן⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩ (Tubal Cain, the inventor of the use of brass and iron); Ceres with ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩גֶּרֶשׁ⸨/lang⸩, crops pushed forward by the influence of the moon.* Walton further argues that the facilities for preserving the original language amongst the worshippers of the true God were great; for, assuming the vulgar reckoning to be correct (rather a serious assumption), Shem, who was living before the confusion of tongues, was still alive in the days of Abraham and Isaac.
⸨in⸩But whatever may be the age of the Hebrew language, it was that language upon which was first conferred by God the honour of being the medium through which the revelation of His will was made known to man. According to Jerome, Eusebius, the Talmudists and ancient Rabbins, the written characters originally employed were those which are now called the Samaritan; and Walton and others are of opinion that these continued in use amongst the Jews until the destruction of the first temple.
⸨in⸩The first critical hand that touched the Hebrew text is supposed to have been that of Ezra, whom the Jews call the second Moses, and whom Jerome calls the “⸨lang:Latin⸩Legis Instaurator⸨/lang⸩.” He is said to have introduced the Assyrian characters in place of the Samaritan.
