⸨in⸩The Greek of Ezra will be found to agree very closely with the Hebrew.
⸨in⸩Of the Book of Ezra the Rev⸼ T⸼ H⸼ Horne observes:—“The zeal and piety of Ezra appear, in this Book, in a most conspicuous point of view. His memory has always been held in the highest reverence amongst the Jews, who consider him a second Moses. Though not expressly styled a prophet, he wrote under the influence of the Divine Spirit, and the canonical authority of his book has never been disputed. He is said to have died in the hundred and twentieth year of his age, and to have been buried at Jerusalem. In Justin the Martyrʼs conference with Trypho the Jew, there is a very extraordinary passage respecting the typical import of the Passover, cited by that father, in which Ezra, in a speech made before the celebration of the Passover, expounds the mystery of it as clearly relating to Christ, and which Justin concludes, was expunged from the Hebrew copies by the Jews at a very early date, as too manifestly favouring the cause of Christianity. The passage may be thus translated: ‘And Ezra said unto the people, This Passover is our Saviour and our Refuge; and if ye shall understand and ponder it in your heart, that we are about to humble Him in this sign, and afterwards shall believe in Him, then this place shall not be made desolate for ever, saith the Lord of hosts. But if ye will not believe in Him, nor hear His preaching, ye shall be a laughing‑stock to the Gentiles.’” This passage is properly regarded as a Gentile interpolation rather than a Jewish expulsion.
