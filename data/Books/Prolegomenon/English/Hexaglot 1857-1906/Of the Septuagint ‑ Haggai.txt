⸨in⸩⸨i⸩Haggai⸨/i⸩.—We have transferred the first clause of chap⸼ ii⸼ 1, Greek and German, to chap⸼ i⸼ 15.
⸨in⸩Hag⸼ ii⸼ 5. The clause, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Καὶ ὁ … τῆς Αἰγύπτου⸨/lang⸩, “According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt,” wanting in Tischendorf and the Codex Vaticanus, is found, but with variations, in the Alexandrian and Complutensian texts. We have adopted the reading of Stier and Theile.
⸨in⸩Hag⸼ ii⸼ 6. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἔτι ἅπαξ ἐγὼ σείσω τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν⸨/lang⸩, agreeing with the Hebrew; cited, substantially, Heb⸼ xii⸼ 26.
⸨in⸩Hag⸼ ii⸼ 9. The phrase, “And peace of soul in abundance to every one that laboureth to raise this my temple,” occurs in the Septuagint alone. So also chap⸼ ii⸼ 14: That which they offer shall be unclean “on account of their early burdens; they shall be pained because of their labours, and ye hated him that reproveth at the gates.”
