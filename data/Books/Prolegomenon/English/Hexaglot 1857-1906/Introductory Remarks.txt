⸨cen⸩INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.

⸨in⸩⸨sc⸩The⸨/sc⸩ number of Polyglot editions of the whole Bible which have been printed is sufficiently limited, and the history of them and their promoters is sufficiently interesting, to deserve passing notice in the foremost pages of the Prolegomenon to this, the latest work of the kind. The Polyglot Bibles already published vary in utility and excellence with their authors, with the place and period of their production, with the texts and versions produced, and with the general plan and execution thereof. They may be thus briefly described:—
⸨in⸩I⸼ ⸨lang:Latin⸩⸨i⸩Biblia Sacra Polyglotta⸨/i⸩, complectentia Vetus Testamentum Hebraico, Græco, et Latino idiomate; Novum Testamentum Græcum et Latinum, et vocabularium Hebraicum et Chaldaicum Veteris Testamenti, cum Grammaticâ Hebraicâ, necnon Dictionario Græco; studio, operâ et impensis Cardinalis Francisci Ximenez de Cisneros. Compluti, 1514⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩1517⸨/lang⸩. Six vols⸼, folio. This is called the Complutensian Polyglot, and its chief promoter and patron was Cardinal Ximenes. The following learned men were employed in the undertaking:—Ælius Antonius Nebrissensis, Demetrius Ducas, Ferdinandus Pincianus, Lopez de Stunica, Alfonsus de Xamora, Paulus Coronellus, and Johannes de Vergera, a physician of Alcala or Complutum.
⸨in⸩II⸼ ⸨lang:Latin⸩⸨i⸩Biblia Sacra Polyglotta⸨/i⸩, Hebraice, Chaldaice, Græce et Latine. Philippi II⸼ Regis Catholici jussu edita ac impressa; cura Benedicti Ariæ Montani, Christophorus Plantinus excudebat. Antverpiæ, 1569⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩1572⸨/lang⸩. Eight vols⸼, folio. This is generally known as the Antwerp Polyglot; sometimes as the ⸨lang:Latin⸩⸨i⸩Biblia Regia⸨/i⸩⸨/lang⸩. The paper and type are superior to those of the Complutensian. No fewer than sixty learned men were occupied on this work, which was at one time highly applauded, at another time ignominiously denounced. The Pope had declared this to be a work truly regal, “⸨lang:Latin⸩Opus vere regium⸨/lang⸩⸨err:”, ⸩,” ⸨/err⸩and the doctors of Paris, Madrid and Louvain proceeded so far as to place it in the catalogue of wonders. Subsequently the Editor, Montanus, was required to make an apology for his heresy; and the bitterness of his brethren grew to such a pitch, that he escaped but with difficulty the horrors of the Inquisition. The projector of the Antwerp Polyglot was Plantin, the printer; and in this instance, it would appear, it was the printer who incurred the pecuniary risk. (This is not generally the case.) Plantin soon discovered that he had entered upon an expensive undertaking, and found himself in want of funds to enable him to defray his expenses. He applied to Philip II⸼ of Spain, and, through the influence of the celebrated Cardinal Spinosa, obtained the money ⸨i⸩as a loan⸨/i⸩⸨err:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/err⸩and then, presently, overwhelmed with a debt which he made every effort, unsuccessfully, to repay, he struggled on beneath the burden until he stumbled and fell into a premature grave.
⸨in⸩III⸼ ⸨lang:Latin⸩⸨i⸩Sacra Biblia⸨/i⸩, Hebraice, Græce et Latine, cum annotationibus Francisci Vatabli, Hebraicæ Linguæ quondam Professoris Regii Lutetiæ. Latina Interpretatio duplex est; altera vetus, altera nova. Omnia cum editione Complutensi diligenter collata; additis in margine, quos Vatablus in suis annotationibus nonnunquam omiserat, idiotismis verborumque difficiliorum radicibus. Ex Offic⸼ Sanctandreana, Heidelb⸼, 1586⸨/lang⸩. Three vols⸼, folio. This is commonly known as Vatableʼs Bible. The editorship has been ascribed by some to Robert Stephen the younger; by others, with greater propriety, to Bertramus, Professor of Hebrew at Geneva. Reprints of this Polyglot appeared in 1599 and 1616.

Norimb⸼ 1591⸨/lang⸩⸨err:. ⸩, ⸨/err⸩Three vols⸼, folio. Hutter had meditated a Polyglot edition of the Old and New Testaments in twelve languages, but he never proceeded with the Old Testament farther than the Book of Ruth. The New Testament was completed in twelve languages. This work was reprinted in four vols⸼ 4to, 1599⸨err:–⸩—⸨/err⸩1610.
⸨in⸩VI⸼ ⸨lang:Latin⸩⸨i⸩Biblia Sacra Polyglotta⸨/i⸩, Hebraica, Samaritana, Chaldaica, Græca, Syriaca, Latina, Arabica.

Lutet⸼ Parisior⸼ 1645⸨/lang⸩. Ten vols⸼, folio. A magnificent edition, but abounding in typographical errors. Dr⸼ Kennicott says⸨err:, “⸩ “⸨/err⸩It was the misfortune of our translators to want these very valuable versions, from which the learned have since derived many and eminent advantages for correcting as well as illustrating the Old Testament.” This, which is known as the “Parisian Polyglot⸨err:”, ⸩,” ⸨/err⸩was completed by the care and at the expense of Michael Le Jay, who had to endure the persecution of the powerful Cardinal Richelieu, a persecution which ultimately succeeded in working Le Jayʼs humiliation and ruin, and in causing many copies of his valuable work to be sold as waste paper or destroyed. Richelieu is charged with having coveted the honour of being considered the author of this work, and with having, for that purpose, made Le Jay an offer of 1🄁000 crowns, an offer which the latter is said to have rejected; hence the persecution.

The delay of publication was owing to a part of the MSS⸼ remaining undiscovered till 1747. Besides the Latin version of Schmid, it contains the German version of Luther from the edition of 1554⸨err:–⸩‑⸨/err⸩5, with marginal notes and parallel passages. Dr⸼ A⸼ Clarke says that it is an excellent and useful work edited with great care and accuracy.

⸨in⸩This is the most valuable and convenient of all the Polyglots hitherto produced. Nine languages are found in it, though no one book of the Bible is printed in so many. Besides all the languages in which the Scriptures had been published in former Polyglots, this one contains the Psalms, Solomonʼs Song, and the New Testament in Æthiopic, and the four Gospels in Persic. The Chaldee Paraphrase is also more complete than in any former publication. The learned Bishop was rewarded for his colossal labour. He was patronised by the Protector, as well as by King Charles II⸼, and richly did he deserve the patronage of them both. The double dedication, of which so much has been said, was without question a prudent yielding to the inspired injunction of the Apostle Paul:—⸨lang:Greek⸩Πᾶσα ψυχὴ ἐξουσίαις ὑπερεχούσαις ὑποτασσέσθω· οὐ γὰρ ἔστιν ἐξουσία εἰ μὴ ὑπὸ θεοῦ⸨/lang⸩. “Let every soul subject himself to the higher powers, for there is no power except under God, and the existing powers are ordained by God.” Castell, whose Lexicon to Bishop Waltonʼs Polyglot is now admitted to be the most elaborate work of the kind ever produced, was less fortunate than the Bishop. Castell, for seventeen years of his life, laboured at his book, and at his own expense employed and maintained no fewer than fourteen literary men. Ultimately, having spent £1🄅000, and being involved in debt, he laid his case before King Charles II⸼ The king graciously recommended his work to the archbishops and bishops; these officially recommended it to their clergy; and the clergy, the working body, by dint of strenuous efforts raised the small sum of £700. At the death of Castell, about 100 copies of his most meritorious work passed into the hands of Compton, then Bishop of London. Had it not been for this providential circumstance, the whole might have perished; for, of the rest, some were gnawed by rats and sold as waste paper, others perished in the memorable fire of London.
