⸨in⸩Amos v⸼ 25⸨fix:–⸩—⸨/fix⸩27. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Μὴ σφάγια καὶ θυσίας προσηνέγκατέ μοι, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, κ⸼τ⸼λ⸼⸨/lang⸩ Here we meet with considerable discrepancy between the Septuagint and the Hebrew. The Evangelist (Acts vii⸼ 43) has, with the Septuagint, ⸨i⸩Remphan⸨/i⸩, for the Hebrew ⸨i⸩Chiun⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩and contrary both to the Hebrew and the Septuagint, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Βαβυλῶνος⸨/lang⸩ for ⸨lang:Greek⸩Δαμασκοῦ⸨/lang⸩.
⸨in⸩Amos ix⸼ 11, 12. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀναστήσω τὴν σκηνὴν Δαυὶδ τὴν πεπτωκυίαν, κ⸼τ⸼λ⸼⸨/lang⸩ The Septuagint here render ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שְׁאֵרִית אֱדֹום⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, “the remnant of Edom,” by ⸨lang:Greek⸩οἱ κατάλοιποι τῶν ἀνθρώπων⸨/lang⸩; “the residue of men.” The Evangelist follows the Septuagint, Acts xv⸼ 16, 17. We strongly suspect that the correct Hebrew reading is ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אדם⸨/lang⸩, not ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אדום⸨/lang⸩. The words ⸨lang:Greek⸩τὸν Κύριον⸨/lang⸩, found in the Alexandrian Codex, and cited by St⸼ Luke, are not in the Hebrew, but they complete the Greek sentence, ⸨lang:Greek⸩ἐκζητήσωσιν οἱ κατάλοιποι, κ⸼τ⸼λ⸼⸨/lang⸩; moreover the word ⸨lang:Greek⸩ἐκζητήσωσιν⸨/lang⸩ of the Septuagint and of the Evangelist does not correspond to the Hebrew ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩יִירְשׁוּ⸨/lang⸩, “they shall possess,” but to ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩יִדְרְשׁוּ⸨/lang⸩, “they shall seek.” These variations impart to the passage under consideration two totally different aspects, the one in favour of the Jews, the other in favour of the Gentiles. We are unwilling to charge either side with wilful corruption; but when we meet with discrepancies of so serious a description, we are impressed and saddened with these two reflections, that the earthly heart will ever and anon deceive the head, and that the heavenly treasure is committed to us only in earthen vessels.
