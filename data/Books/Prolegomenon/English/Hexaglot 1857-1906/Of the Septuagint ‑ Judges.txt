It has been affirmed, but whether upon good authority or not we cannot presume to say, that the Jews, in order to take away the reproach of their Lawgiverʼs grandson being the first idolatrous priest among them, inserted the ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נ⸨/lang⸩ for the purpose of changing the name from Moses to Manasseh.
