⸨cen⸩OF VOWEL‑POINTS AND ACCENTS.

⸨in⸩With regard to the system of Hebrew accentuation and punctuation, it may be observed that the date of the introduction of accents and vowels is involved in uncertainty. Some have affirmed that these are coeval with the text, and have ascribed them to Moses; others have ascribed them to Ezra; others to the Masorites of Tiberias, about ⸨sc⸩a⸼d⸼⸨/sc⸩ 500; others again to Ben Asher and Ben Naphtali, ⸨sc⸩a⸼d⸼⸨/sc⸩ 1040.
⸨in⸩Bishop Walton shows tolerably clearly that the Hebrew vowels and accents are of comparatively modern date. He bases his argument against their antiquity upon the testimony of learned men, the absence of points from the Samaritan as well as from the ancient copies of the Jewish Synagogues, the evidence of the most learned of the Jews themselves, Elias Levitas and Aben Ezra; the Talmud, which makes no mention of points; the Keri and Ketib, which refer to words and letters, never to vowels or accents; the ancient versions, etc⸼
⸨in⸩It is, we think, now generally conceded that these were first introduced after the Hebrew language had ceased to be vernacular, the object being simply to facilitate the reading of the text, and the credit of the invention is attributed to the Masorites, about the tenth or eleventh century. Whatever doubt there may be as to the antiquity of the vowel‑points and accents, there can be none as to their general utility now in determining the pronunciation and accentuation of syllables, the signification of words, and the construction of sentences.
⸨in⸩We shall shew now, from internal evidence, that the Greek translation, ⸨fix:⸨i⸩i⸼e⸼⸨/i⸩⸩⸨i⸩i⸼ e⸼⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩, the Septuagint, was made either from an unpointed text, or from a text pointed differently from the present. This we shall endeavour to establish by examples, some of which have been adduced before, others not, as far as we are aware.
⸨in⸩Take Gen⸼ iv⸼ 7: “If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.” This is a fair rendering of the Hebrew, as it is now pointed: ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הֲלֹא אִם־תֵּיטִיב שְׂאֵת וְאִם לֹא תֵיטִיב לַפֶּתַח חַטָּאת רֹבֵץ וְאֵלֶיךָ תְּשׁוּקָתֹו וְאַתָּה תִּמְשָׁל־בֹּו⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩. But in addition to not being very intelligible or connected, this is ungrammatical; for ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חַטָּאת⸨/lang⸩ is a feminine form, whereas ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩רֹבֵץ⸨/lang⸩ is a participle masculine, and therefore does not agree with the substantive, as it should. Now it appears to us that the Greek throws great light upon the passage. It runs thus: ⸨lang:Greek⸩Οὐκ ἐὰν ὀρθῶς προσενέγκῃς, ὀρθῶς δὲ μὴ διέλῃς, ἥμαρτες; ἡσύχασον κ⸼τ⸼λ⸼⸨/lang⸩ This is not a paraphrase on the Hebrew, it is manifestly a translation either from an unpointed text, or from one pointed quite differently: ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הֲלֹא אִם תֵּיטִיב שְׂאֵת וְאִם לֹא תֵיטִיב לִפְתֹּחַ חָטָאתָ רְבֹץ⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩ “If thou doest well in offering, but if thou doest not well in setting forth, hast thou not erred? Be still, and unto thee,” etc⸼ ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שְׂאֵת⸨/lang⸩ is a feminine form of the infinitive, governed by ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩תֵּיטִיב⸨/lang⸩. For the signification of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לִפְתֹּחַ⸨/lang⸩ compare Amos viii⸼ 5, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩וְנִפְתְּחָה־בָּר⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩ἀνοίξομεν θήσαυρον⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩aperiemus frumentum⸨/lang⸩, ⸨lang:German⸩Korn feil haben⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩set forth wheat⸨/i⸩.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ iv⸼ 15. For ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לָכֵן⸨/lang⸩ the Septuagint reads ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לֹא כֵן⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩ ⸨lang:Greek⸩οὐχ οὕτω⸨/lang⸩, ⸨fix:Vulg⸼⸩Vulg⸨/fix⸩, ⸨lang:Latin⸩Nequaquam ita fiet⸨/lang⸩.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xxvi⸼ 12. “Then Isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an hundredfold.” Here the Hebrew, as at present pointed, is ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩מֵאָה שְׁעָרִים⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩; the Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩ἑκατοστεύουσαν κριθήν⸨/lang⸩, and therefore the translator must have read ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שְׂעֹרִים⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩barley⸨/i⸩. Compare Ruth i⸼ 22, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩קְצִיר שְׂעֹרִים⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, ⸨i⸩barley‑harvest⸨/i⸩.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xlvii⸼ 31. “And Israel bowed himself upon the bedʼs head.” Septuagint: ⸨lang:Greek⸩Καὶ προσεκύνησεν Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς ῥάβδου αὐτοῦ⸨/lang⸩. “And Israel worshipped on the top of his staff.” The Hebrew has ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩המטה⸨/lang⸩, which, unpointed, may signify either the ⸨i⸩bed⸨/i⸩ or the ⸨i⸩staff⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩as it is pointed in our copies, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הַמִּטָּה⸨/lang⸩, it signifies ⸨i⸩the bed⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩as it is rendered in the Greek, ⸨lang:Greek⸩τῆς ῥάβδου⸨/lang⸩, it must have been read as if pointed ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הַמַּטֶּה⸨/lang⸩. Cited from the Septuagint, Heb⸼ xi⸼ 21. The Vulgate follows the Hebrew in the Old Testament, “⸨lang:Latin⸩ad lectuli caput⸨/lang⸩;” in the New Testament we find, “⸨lang:Latin⸩et adoravit fastigium virgæ ejus⸨/lang⸩;” “and he adored the top of his staff!”
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xlix⸼ 10. “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come.” The word Shiloh (⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שִׁילֹה⸨/lang⸩) is here translated by the Septuagint, ⸨lang:Greek⸩τὰ ἀποκείμενα αὐτῷ⸨/lang⸩, or, as the Alexandrian MS⸼ renders it, ⸨lang:Greek⸩ᾧ ἀπόκειται⸨/lang⸩; “until the things laid up in store for him,” or, “he for whom it is laid up in store, shall come.” In this sense ⸨lang:Greek⸩ἀπόκειμαι⸨/lang⸩ is employed in the New Testament, ⸨i⸩e⸼g⸼⸨/i⸩, 2 Tim⸼ iv⸼ 8: “Henceforth there is laid up for me (⸨lang:Greek⸩ἀπόκειταί μοι⸨/lang⸩) a crown of righteousness.” The words ⸨lang:Greek⸩καὶ αὐτὸς προσδοκία ἐθνῶν⸨/lang⸩, “and he ⸨i⸩shall⸨/i⸩ be the expectation of nations,” indicate that the translators understood Shiloh to be a person, although instead of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שִׁילֹה⸨/lang⸩ they must have read ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שֶׁלֹּו⸨/lang⸩. Possibly they had an eye to an old Talmudic tradition respecting the glory laid up for the Messiah.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xlix⸼ 21. “Naphtali is a hind let loose; he giveth goodly words.” This is a literal translation of the Hebrew, as at present pointed: ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נַפְתָּלִי אַיָּלָה שְׁלֻחָה הַנֹּתֵן אִמְרֵי־שָׁפֶר⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩. But the Septuagint translates thus: ⸨lang:Greek⸩Νεφθαλὶ στέλεχος ἀνειμένον ἐπιδιδοὺς ἐν τῷ γεννήματι κάλλος⸨/lang⸩; “Naphtali is a well spread tree, which puts out beautiful branches.” The latter is a great improvement on the former. For ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אַיָּלָה⸨/lang⸩ the translators must have read ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אֵילָה⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩a tree⸨/i⸩. The verb ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שָׁלַח⸨/lang⸩, in the Piel, signifies ⸨i⸩to send forth⸨/i⸩, as a bough; Psalm lxxx⸼ 12, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩תְּשַׁלַּח קְצִירֶיהָ עַד יָם⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, “she sendeth forth her boughs unto the sea.” The first meaning of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אֵמֶר⸨/lang⸩ is ⸨i⸩a branch⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩the second, ⸨i⸩a discourse⸨/i⸩, is metaphorical, that which branches from the subject. The verb ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נָתַן⸨/lang⸩ is applied to the giving forth of ⸨i⸩fruit⸨/i⸩, rather than words, ⸨i⸩e⸼g⸼⸨/i⸩, Psalm i⸼ 3: ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אֲשֶׁר פִּרְיֹו יִתֵּן בְּעִתֹּו⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, “that bringeth forth his fruit in his season.” All this is well expressed in the words of the Septuagint.
⸨in⸩Exod⸼ xiii⸼ 18. “And the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.” The Hebrew is ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩וַחֲמֻשִּׁים עָלוּ בְנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵל⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩. The Greek is ⸨lang:Greek⸩πέμπτῃ δὲ γενεᾷ ἀνέβησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ⸨/lang⸩; “And the children of Israel went up in the fifth generation.” Consequently for ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חֲמֻשִּׁים⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩armed⸨/i⸩ or ⸨i⸩harnessed⸨/i⸩, the translators must have read ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חִמֵּשִׁים⸨/lang⸩. We find a striking parallel at Exodus xx⸼ 5: “Visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation;” ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩עַל שִׁלֵּשִׁים וְעַל רִבֵּעִים⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩; Septuagint, ⸨lang:Greek⸩ἑως τρίτης καὶ τετάρτης γενεᾶς⸨/lang⸩; Vulg⸼, “⸨lang:Latin⸩in tertiam et quartam generationem⸨/lang⸩.” So in all versions. Now if this rendering of the Septuagint be correct, and by the consent of nations unto whom the word of God has come, it is correct; is it not highly probable that ⸨lang:Greek⸩πέμπτῃ δὲ γενεᾷ⸨/lang⸩ is the real meaning of the word ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חמשים⸨/lang⸩, in the passage under consideration? And if this be so, then the whole of the argument of Bishop Colenso against the historical truth of the Pentateuch, based on this difficult word (Part I⸼, chap⸼ ix⸼, page 48⸨fix:–⸩—⸨/fix⸩52) must inevitably fall to the ground. The theory of the Israelites going up out of Egypt armed, is supported by the Vulgate ⸨lang:Latin⸩⸨i⸩armati⸨/i⸩⸨/lang⸩ alone. The English version has ⸨i⸩harnessed⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩German, ⸨lang:German⸩gerüſtet⸨/lang⸩, both of which may signify ⸨i⸩equipped⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩with a good outfit⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩and with this the French agrees, “⸨lang:French⸩en bon ordre⸨/lang⸩,” ⸨i⸩in good order⸨/i⸩. Had the Hebrew but been pointed from the outset, the unfortunate question to which we have referred, would, perhaps, never have been raised.
⸨in⸩Psalm lxxvii⸼ 10 (11). “And I said, This is my infirmity, but ⸨i⸩I will remember⸨/i⸩ the years of the right hand of the Most High.” Hebrew: ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩וָאֹמַר חַלֹּותִי הִיא שְׁנֹות יְמִין עֶלְיֹון⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩. Greek: ⸨lang:Greek⸩Καὶ ἐ͂ιπα Νῦν ἠρξάμην, αὕτη ἡ ἀλλοίωσις τῆς δεξιᾶς τοῦ ὑψίστου⸨/lang⸩; “And I said, Now I have begun, this ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the changing of the right hand of the Most High.” The Vulgate follows the Greek. Here the word ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חַלֹּותִי⸨/lang⸩, which in our English Version is rendered ⸨i⸩my infirmity⸨/i⸩, is treated as the first person singular preterite Kal of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חָלַל⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩to begin⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩the word ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הִיא⸨/lang⸩, which now has the ⸨i⸩athnach⸨/i⸩, ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩-֑⸨/lang⸩, was separated from ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חַלֹּותִי⸨/lang⸩ and joined to ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שְׁנֹות⸨/lang⸩; while ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שְׁנֹות⸨/lang⸩, which in the English is translated ⸨i⸩the years⸨/i⸩, ⸨fix:⸨i⸩i⸼e⸼⸨/i⸩⸩⸨i⸩i e⸼⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩, as a substantive, was treated as the infinitive Kal of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שָׁנָה⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩to change⸨/i⸩. The true meaning seems to lie between the two: ⸨i⸩And I said, It is my infirmity to change the right hand of the Most High⸨/i⸩. However this may be, the accents, if they existed at all when the Greek translation was made, must have been different from those which are found in our present copies.
⸨in⸩Isaiah xxiv⸼ 23. “Then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed.” Hebrew, as now pointed, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩וְחָפְרָה הַלְּבָנָה וּבֹושָׁה הַחַמָּה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩; Greek, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Καὶ τακήσεται ἡ πλίνθος καὶ πεσεῖται τὸ τεῖχος⸨/lang⸩. “And the brick shall be dissolved, and the wall shall fall.” The translators must have read ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הַלְּבֵנָה⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩the brick⸨/i⸩, and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הַחֹמָה⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩the wall⸨/i⸩, for ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הַלְּבָנָה⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩the moon⸨/i⸩, and ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הַחַמָּה⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩the sun⸨/i⸩.
⸨in⸩Ezekiel xlviii⸼ 35. “And the name of the city from that day shall be The Lord is there.” Hebrew, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩⸨fix:וְשֵׁם⸩וִשֵם⸨/fix⸩ הָעִיר מִיֹּום יְהֹוָה שָׁמָּה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩; Greek, ⸨lang:Greek⸩καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τῆς πόλεως ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἂν ἡμέρας γένηται ἔσται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς⸨/lang⸩; “And the name of the city from the day when it happens shall be its name.” Some copies have ⸨lang:Greek⸩Κύριος ἐκεῖ⸨/lang⸩, but the majority have not; and hence it would seem that the translators read ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩יִהְיֶה שְׁמָה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, ⸨i⸩shall be its name⸨/i⸩, for ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩יְהֹוָה שָׁמָּה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, ⸨i⸩the Lord is there⸨/i⸩. The confusion may be traced to the Bava Bathra (fol⸼ 75, col⸼ 2): “Read not ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שָׁמָּה⸨/lang⸩, read ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שְׁמָה⸨/lang⸩.”
