⸨in⸩Genesis ii⸼ 24. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἕνεκα τούτου καταλείψει, ⸨fix:κ⸼τ⸼λ⸼⸩κ⸼τ⸼λ⸨/fix⸩⸨/lang⸩, “For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.” The Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩οἱ δύο⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩the two⸨/i⸩. This is cited by St⸼ Matthew (xix⸼ 5), and is considered to be a ⸨i⸩protest⸨/i⸩ against polygamy.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ iii⸼ 15. “He shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” Gesenius explains ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הוּא יְשׁוּפִךָ⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩ thus: “He (the seed of the woman, man) shall lie in wait for thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for his heel;” he shall endeavour to crush thy head, and thou shalt endeavour to crush his heel. Tregelles adds in a note: “The above explanation is purely neologian; the passage applies not to man generally, but to Christ, the seed of the woman; ⸨i⸩bruise⸨/i⸩ is the simple meaning in each part of the verse.” Here, we think, Gesenius is right, and Tregelles is wrong. Christ, the seed of the woman, was not merely a man, He was the representative of man, the second Adam; “⸨lang:Latin⸩Ecce homo⸨/lang⸩.” As to ⸨i⸩bruise⸨/i⸩ being the only meaning of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שׁוּף⸨/lang⸩, it is questionable whether it possesses any such meaning. Most of the Greek copies have ⸨lang:Greek⸩τηρήσει⸨/lang⸩, which signifies ⸨i⸩to lie in wait for⸨/i⸩, not ⸨i⸩to bruise⸨/i⸩.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ iv⸼ 8. “And Cain talked with Abel, his brother.” Here the Hebrew is, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩וַיֹּאמֶר קַיִן אֶל־הֶבֶל אָחִיו⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, And Cain ⸨i⸩said⸨/i⸩ (not ⸨i⸩talked⸨/i⸩) to Abel, his brother. The verb ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אָמַר⸨/lang⸩ is active, and requires the objective case after it to complete the sense. There is therefore something wanting in the Hebrew text. This we find supplied in the Septuagint, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Διελθώμεν εἰς τὸ πεδίον⸨/lang⸩; ⸨i⸩Let us pass through the field⸨/i⸩. The Hebrew of this would be, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נַעֲבֹור בַּשָּׂדֶה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩ or ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩נֵלְכָה⸨/lang⸩. Probably the Hebrew transcriber omitted the clause by accident, his eye having been deceived by falling on the second word ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩בַּשָּׂדֶה⸨/lang⸩. The clause is found in the Syriac version, the Jerusalem Targum, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Latin Vulgate, “⸨lang:Latin⸩egrediamur foras⸨/lang⸩.”
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ ix⸼ 20. “Noah began ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ an husbandman;” Hebrew, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אִישׁ הָאֲדָמָה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩; Greek, ⸨lang:Greek⸩ἄνθρωπος γεωργὸς γῆς⸨/lang⸩. The original rendering of the Septuagint was, ⸨lang:Greek⸩ἄνθρωπος γῆς⸨/lang⸩, but the expression admitting of two senses, the word ⸨lang:Greek⸩γεωργὸς⸨/lang⸩ was placed first in the margin, to explain the meaning, then in the text, to the detriment of the sense. This is one of the numerous double renderings with which we meet in the Septuagint.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xi⸼ 12, 13. “And Arphaxad lived five‑and‑thirty years and begat Salah. And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years,” etc⸼ This is a literal translation of the Hebrew; but the Greek runs thus: “And Arphaxad lived a hundred and thirty‑five years, and begat Cainan; and Arphaxad lived after he begat Cainan four hundred years, and begat sons and daughters; and he died. And Cainan lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat Salah, and Cainan lived after he begat Salah three hundred and thirty years,” etc⸼ Throughout this chapter the Greek dates are irreconcileable with the Hebrew. This and other points, upon which we cannot enter now, indicate clearly either that the translatorsʼ copy was different from that which we possess, or else that the Hebrew or the Greek has been corrupted since.

⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xv⸼ 15. ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩תִּקָּבֵר בְּשֵׂיבָה טֹובָה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, “thou shalt be buried in a good old age.” The Greek has ⸨lang:Greek⸩τραφεὶς⸨/lang⸩, obviously erroneously written for ⸨lang:Greek⸩ταφείς⸨/lang⸩.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xvi⸼ 13. “And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest me.” Hebrew, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אַתָּה אֵל רֳאִי⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩; Septuagint, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Σὺ ὁ θεὸς ὁ ἐπιδών με⸨/lang⸩. In this and similar instances ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩ראי⸨/lang⸩ is an abstract substantive, signifying ⸨i⸩vision⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩she called the name of the Lord, ⸨i⸩the God of vision⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩just as the well was called ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩בְּאֵר לַחַי רֹאִי⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, Beer‑lahai‑roi, ⸨i⸩vision to the living⸨/i⸩.

At Rom⸼ ix⸼ 9, we have ⸨lang:Greek⸩Κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν το͂υτον ἐλεύσομαι καὶ ἔσται τῇ Σάρρᾳ υἱός⸨/lang⸩. If we assume that for ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩חַיָּה⸨/lang⸩ the Apostle read ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩הַזֶּה⸨/lang⸩, this citation agrees with the Hebrew, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אָשׁוּב אֵלֶיךָ כָּעֵת ⸨fix:חַיָּה⸩חַיָּח⸨/fix⸩ וְהִנֵּה־בֵן לְשָׂרָה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩.

⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xviii⸼ 22. Here we have one of the eighteen ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩תקון ספרים⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, or corrections of the Jewish scribes:—“But Abraham stood yet before the Lord.” The true reading is said to be, “But the Lord stood yet before Abraham.” The correction, which was unnecessary, has been adopted in all versions.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xxi⸼ 10. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἔκβαλε τὴν παιδίσκην ταύτην καὶ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς· οὐ γὰρ μὴ κληρονομήσει ὁ υἱὸς τῆς παιδίσκης ταύτης μετὰ τοῦ υἱοῦ μου Ἰσαάκ⸨/lang⸩, agreeing with the Hebrew, and cited by St⸼ Paul, Gal⸼ iv⸼ 30, except that for the last clause, ⸨lang:Greek⸩τοῦ υἱοῦ μου Ἰσαάκ⸨/lang⸩, he substitutes ⸨lang:Greek⸩τῆς ἐλευθέρας⸨/lang⸩.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xxi⸼ 12. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἐν Ἰσαὰκ κληθήσεταί σοι σπέρμα⸨/lang⸩, agreeing with the Hebrew; cited by St⸼ Paul, Rom⸼ ix⸼ 7.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xxi⸼ 16. “And she (Hagar) sat over against ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩, and lift up her voice, and wept.” This is a translation of the Hebrew, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩וַתִּשָּׂא אֶת־קֹלָהּ וַתֵּבְךְּ⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩; the Greek has, ⸨lang:Greek⸩ἀναβοήσαν δὲ τὸ παιδίον ἔκλαυσεν⸨/lang⸩, “And the child lifted up his voice and wept.” At ver⸼ 17 we read, “And God heard the voice of the lad.” It has been said that it was evidently the child who wept, and not the mother, and that the Greek in this case corrects the Hebrew. Is it not more probable that mother and child wept together, till the child, at the point of death, could weep no more? and then, when the mother wept alone for her son, he wept by and through her, and the Lord heard his voice?
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xxii⸼ 14. “And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah‑jireh; as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.” The Hebrew of the last clause is, ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩בְּהַר יְהֹוָה יֵרָאֶה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, and with this the Greek agrees, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἐν τῷ ὄρει Κύριος ὤφθη⸨/lang⸩, ⸨i⸩the Lord appeared⸨/i⸩. There evidently is, and was when the Greek translation was made, some confusion with the reading of ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩יראה⸨/lang⸩. The place is called ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩יְהֹוָה יִרְאֶה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, because ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩יְהֹוָה יֵרָאֶה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Κύριος εἶδεν⸨/lang⸩ because ⸨lang:Greek⸩Κύριος ὤφθη⸨/lang⸩. The real meaning is obvious from ver⸼ 8, “My son, ⸨i⸩God will provide⸨/i⸩,” ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩אֱלֹהִים יִרְאֶה⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩. The present English rendering is nonsense.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xxii⸼ 17. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἦ μὲν εὐλογῶν εὐλογήσω σε καὶ πληθύνων πληθυνῶ τὸ σπέρμα σου⸨/lang⸩, agreeing with the Hebrew; cited by St⸼ Paul, Heb⸼ vi⸼ 14, except that for ⸨lang:Greek⸩τὸ σπέρμα σου⸨/lang⸩ he substitutes ⸨lang:Greek⸩σε⸨/lang⸩.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xxii⸼ 18. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Καὶ εὐλογηθήσονται ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς⸨/lang⸩. Comp⸼ xii⸼ 3, xviii⸼ 18, xxvi⸼ 4. St⸼ Luke has (Acts iii⸼ 25) ⸨lang:Greek⸩Καὶ ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου ἐνευλογηθήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ πατριαὶ τῆς γῆς⸨/lang⸩; and St⸼ Paul (Gal⸼ iii⸼ 8), ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ὅτι ἐνευλογηθήσονται ἐν σοὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη⸨/lang⸩. Neither of these is an exact citation, although both embody the sense and spirit of the oft repeated promise that in Abrahamʼs seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xxv⸼ 23. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ὁ μείζων δουλεύσει τῷ ἐλάσσονι⸨/lang⸩, agreeing with the Hebrew; cited by St⸼ Paul, Rom⸼ ix⸼ 12.
⸨in⸩At Gen⸼ xxxv⸼ 4, there is a clause added to the Greek text which, if true, must have been of greater moment to the patriarch Jacob than to ourselves. “They gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hands, and the earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which is by Shechem;” the Greek adds, ⸨lang:Greek⸩καὶ ἀπώλεσεν αὖτα ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας⸨/lang⸩; ⸨i⸩And he lost them unto the present day⸨/i⸩.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xliv⸼ 4, 5. The English version, following the Hebrew, begins thus abruptly, “Is not this it in which my lord drinketh?” The Greek prefixed the words, ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἰνατί ἐκλέψατέ μου τὸ κόνδυ τὸ ἀργυροῦν; ⸨/lang⸩⸨i⸩Why have ye stolen my silver cup? ⸨/i⸩We may imagine, without being very speculative, that the words of the original were ⸨rtl⸩⸨lang:Hebrew⸩לָמָה גְנַבְתֶּם אֶת־גְּבִיעִי גְבִיעַ הַכֶּסֶף⸨/lang⸩⸨/rtl⸩.
⸨in⸩Gen⸼ xlvi⸼ 20. ⸨lang:Greek⸩Ἐγενοντο δὲ υἱοὶ Μανασσῆ, οὗς ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ … Ἐδωμ⸨/lang⸩. We have an interpolation here in the Septuagint of some moment, because it has led to ⸨lang:Greek⸩ἑβδομηκονταπέντε⸨/lang⸩, seventy‑five, instead of seventy, v⸼ 27, contrary to the Hebrew and the other versions, an error which reappears in the New Testament, Acts vii⸼ 14.

None of these interpretations throw much light upon the passage. Some have taken the words ⸨lang:Hebrew⸩שור⸨/lang⸩ and ⸨lang:Greek⸩ταῦρος⸨/lang⸩ in the sense of ⸨i⸩prince⸨/i⸩, viz⸼, Shechem, who was thus cruelly punished in revenge for his ignominious conduct.
