⸨in⸩2 Chron⸼ xxvii⸼ 8, the words ⸨lang:Greek⸩καὶ εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν ἦν βασιλεύσας, κ⸼τ⸼λ⸼⸨/lang⸩, are also supplied from the same source.
⸨in⸩2 Chron⸼ xxxv⸼ 20. There is a long paragraph in the Cod⸼ Vat⸼ which is not found in the Hebrew, and which is probably taken from 2 Kings xxiii⸼ 24⸨fix:–⸩—⸨/fix⸩27. Josiah puts away the various abominations of Judah, that he may perform the words of the Book of the Law, which Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord. Josiah, in an earnest manner, turns to the Lord, but the Lord determines notwithstanding, in consequence of the provocations of Manasseh, to remove Judah and Jerusalem out of his sight.
⸨in⸩2 Chron⸼ xxxvi⸼ 2. Referring to Jehoahaz, “And his motherʼs name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done.” This passage is not found in the Hebrew or in the other versions, and is probably taken from 2 Kings xxiii⸼ 31, 32.
⸨in⸩2 Chron⸼ xxxvi⸼ 4. After the words, “Necho took Jehoahaz to Egypt,” the Cod⸼ Vat⸼ has, “And he died there, and gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh, but taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh; he exacted the silver and gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh‑Necho.” This passage is obviously borrowed from 2 Kings xxiii⸼ 34, 35.
⸨in⸩2 Chron⸼ xxxvi⸼ 5. Here there is a long interpolation in the Cod⸼ Vat⸼ in reference to the coming up of Nebuchadnezzar against Jehoiakim, and of bands of the Chaldees, Syrians, Moabites and Ammonites, to destroy Judah for the unpardonable crimes of Manasseh. This interpolation is taken from 2 Kings xxiv⸼ 1⸨fix:–⸩—⸨/fix⸩4.
