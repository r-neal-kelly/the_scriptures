⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ round about him that is slain:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And it shall be, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ the city ⸨i⸩which is⸨/i⸩ next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ which hath not drawn in the yoke;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heiferʼs neck there in the valley:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; and by their ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩word shall every controversy and every stroke be ⸨i⸩tried⸨/i⸩⸨fix::⸩⸨i⸩:⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:mouth⸩mo·th⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And all the elders of that city, ⸨i⸩that are⸨/i⸩ next unto the slain ⸨i⸩man⸨/i⸩, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ Be merciful, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩unto thy people of Israelʼs charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩in the ⸨fix:midst⸩mi··t⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ So shalt thou put away the ⸨i⸩guilt of⸨/i⸩ innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do ⸨i⸩that which is⸨/i⸩ right in the sight of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ¶ When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and ⸨sup⸩⸨fix:❙✝⸩❙⸨/fix⸩⸨/sup⸩pare her nails;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩suffer to grow⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸩⸨/fix⸩Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩make⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩dress⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ ¶ If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, ⸨i⸩both⸨/i⸩ the beloved and the hated; and ⸨i⸩if⸨/i⸩ the firstborn son be hers that was hated:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ which he hath, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, ⸨i⸩which is indeed⸨/i⸩ the firstborn:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩that he hath: for he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ his.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩that is found with him⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ ¶ If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; ⸨i⸩he is⸨/i⸩ a glutton, and a drunkard.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ he that is hanged ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God giveth thee ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ an inheritance.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Gal⸼⸩G·l⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:3⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 13⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩the curse of God⸨/i⸩.
