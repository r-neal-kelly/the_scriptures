⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ For the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ portion ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ his people; Jacob ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩lot of his inheritance.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩cord⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:compassed⸩c·mpassed⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:him⸩·im⸨/fix⸩ about⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩So⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ alone did lead him, and ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ no strange god with him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ ¶ But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered ⸨i⸩with fatness⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩then he forsook God ⸨i⸩which⸨/i⸩ made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ They provoked him to jealousy with strange ⸨i⸩gods⸨/i⸩, with abominations provoked they him to anger.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ They sacrificed unto devils, ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new ⸨i⸩gods that⸨/i⸩ came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, which were ⸨i⸩not God⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ Of the Rock ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And when the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ saw ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, he ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩abhorred ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:despised⸩·e·pis·d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ They have moved me to jealousy with ⸨i⸩that which is⸨/i⸩ not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ I will move them to jealousy with ⸨i⸩those which are⸨/i⸩ not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Rom⸼ ⸨fix:10⸼⸩··⸨/fix⸩ 9⸼

⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:⸨marg⸩
