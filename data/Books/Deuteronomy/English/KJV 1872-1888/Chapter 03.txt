⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩Then⸨/sc⸩ we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Numb⸼ 21⸼ ⸨fix:33⸼⸩33⸨/fix⸩, &c⸼⸨row⸩chap⸼ 29⸼ 7⸼
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Numb⸼ 21⸼ 24⸼
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ So the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ our God delivered into our hands ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Numb⸼ 21⸼ 33⸼
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ All these cities ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ (⸨i⸩Which⸨/i⸩ Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ a bedstead of iron; ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And this land, ⸨i⸩which⸨/i⸩ we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩⸨/sup⸩ Numb⸼ 32⸼ 33⸼⸨row⸩Josh⸼ 13⸼ ⸨fix:8⸼⸩8⸨/fix⸩, &c⸼
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, ⸨i⸩being⸨/i⸩ the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, ⸨fix:⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩e⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Bashan‑havoth‑jair⸩Bashan‑⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩e⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩havoth‑jair⸨/fix⸩, unto this day.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩e⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Numb⸼ 32⸼ ⸨fix:41⸼⸩·1⸼⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And I gave Gilead unto Machir.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, ⸨i⸩which is⸨/i⸩ the border of the children of Ammon;⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ Ye shall not fear them: for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God he shall fight for you.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.⸨marg⸩
