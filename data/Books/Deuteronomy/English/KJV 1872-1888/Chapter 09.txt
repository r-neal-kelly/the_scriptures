⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and ⸨i⸩of whom⸨/i⸩ thou hast heard ⸨i⸩say⸨/i⸩, Who can stand before ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ the children of Anak!⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Numb⸼ 13⸼ 28⸼
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ Understand therefore this day, that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ he which goeth over before thee; ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ a ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath said unto thee.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 4⸼ ⸨fix:24⸼⸩2·⸼⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩Heb⸼ 12⸼ 29⸼
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ doth drive them out from before thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Understand therefore, that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ a stiffnecked people.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Remember, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ forget not, how thou provokedst the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ Also in Horeb ye provoked the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ to wrath, so that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was angry with you to have destroyed you.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ the tables of the covenant which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ made with you, then ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Exod⸼ 24⸼ 18⸼⸨row⸩& 34⸼ 28⸼
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them ⸨i⸩was written⸨/i⸩ according to all the words, which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Exod⸼ 31⸼ 18⸼
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ gave me the two tables of stone, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ the tables of the covenant.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto me, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩e⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted ⸨i⸩themselves⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩e⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Exod⸼ 32⸼ 7⸼
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Furthermore the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a stiffnecked people:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ in my two hands.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had commanded you.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And I fell down before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, to provoke him to anger.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was wroth against you to destroy you. But the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hearkened unto me at that time also.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ ground ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ very small, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And at ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩f⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Taberah, and at ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩g⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Massah, and at ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩h⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Kibroth‑hattaavah, ye provoked the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ to wrath.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩f⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Numb⸼ 11⸼ ⸨fix:1⸼⸩1⸨/fix⸩, 3⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩g⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Exod⸼ 17⸼ 7⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩h⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Numb⸼ ⸨fix:11⸼⸩··⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:34⸼⸩·4⸼⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ Likewise when the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ sent you from Kadesh‑barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ Ye have been rebellious against the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ from the day that I knew you.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ Thus I fell down before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ forty days and forty nights, as I fell down ⸨i⸩at the first⸨/i⸩⸨fix:; ⸩⸨i⸩; ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩because the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had said he would destroy you.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ I prayed therefore unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and said, O Lord ⸨sc⸩God⸨/sc⸩, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩i⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Because the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩i⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Numb⸼ 14⸼ 16⸼
