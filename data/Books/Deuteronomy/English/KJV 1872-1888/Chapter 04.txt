⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sonsʼ sons;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩Specially⸨/i⸩ the day that thou stoodest before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God in Horeb, when the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ they may teach their children.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ mountain burned with fire unto the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Exod⸼ ⸨fix:19⸼⸩··⸨/fix⸩ 18⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:heart⸩·eart⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩only ⸨i⸩ye heard⸨/i⸩ a voice.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩save a voice⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ Lest ye corrupt ⸨i⸩yourselves⸨/i⸩, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God hath ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩imparted⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩

⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ Furthermore the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God giveth thee ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ an inheritance:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong ⸨i⸩your⸨/i⸩ days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall lead you.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And there ye shall serve gods, the work of menʼs hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ⸨i⸩ask⸨/i⸩ from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been ⸨i⸩any such thing⸨/i⸩ as this great thing ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩, or hath been heard like it?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ Did ⸨i⸩ever⸨/i⸩ people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩34⸨/sub⸩ Or hath God assayed to go ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ take him a nation from the midst of ⸨i⸩another⸨/i⸩ nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩35⸨/sub⸩ Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ God; ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ none else beside him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩36⸨/sub⸩ Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩37⸨/sub⸩ And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩39⸨/sub⸩ Know therefore this day, and consider ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ in thine heart, that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ none else.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩40⸨/sub⸩ Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong ⸨i⸩thy⸨/i⸩ days upon the earth, which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God giveth thee, for ever.⸨marg⸩
