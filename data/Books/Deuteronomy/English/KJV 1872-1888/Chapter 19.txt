⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And this ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩in time past;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩from yesterday the third day⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩slay him; whereas he ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩in time past.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩smite him⸨/i⸩ in ⸨i⸩life⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩from yesterday the third day⸨/i⸩.
