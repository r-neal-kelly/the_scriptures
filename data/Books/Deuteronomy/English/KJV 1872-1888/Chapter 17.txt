⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ ¶ If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God, in transgressing his covenant,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And it be told thee, and thou hast heard ⸨i⸩of it⸨/i⸩, and inquired diligently, and, behold, ⸨i⸩it be⸨/i⸩ true, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ the thing certain, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ such abomination is wrought in Israel:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, ⸨i⸩being⸨/i⸩ matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God shall choose;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, ⸨i⸩to⸨/i⸩ the right hand, nor ⸨i⸩to⸨/i⸩ the left.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Thou shalt in any wise set ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ king over thee, whom the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God shall choose: ⸨i⸩one⸨/i⸩ from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not thy brother.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of ⸨i⸩that which is⸨/i⸩ before the priests the Levites:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:⸨marg⸩
