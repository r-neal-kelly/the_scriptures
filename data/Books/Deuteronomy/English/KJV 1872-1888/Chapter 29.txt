⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ye have seen all that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Exod⸼ 19⸼ 4⸼
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Yet the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And when ⸨fix:ye⸩·e⸨/fix⸩ came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Ye stand this day all of you before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, ⸨i⸩with⸨/i⸩ all the men of Israel,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ That thou shouldest ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩enter into covenant with the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God, and into his oath, which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God maketh with thee this day:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩pass⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ But with ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ that standeth here with us this day before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ our God, and also with ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not here with us this day:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And ye have seen their abominations, and their ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ among them:)⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩dungy gods⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ our God, to go ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth ⸨sup⸩⸨fix:❙✝⸩❙⸨/fix⸩⸨/sup⸩gall and wormwood;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩a ⸨fix:poisonful⸩poisonf··⸨/fix⸩ herb⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸩⸨/fix⸩Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩rosh⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩imagination of mine heart, to add ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩drunkenness to thirst:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩stubbornness⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩the drunken to the thirsty⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ The ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will not spare him, but then the anger of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall blot out his name from under heaven.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩are written in this book of the law:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩is written⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath laid upon it;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩wherewith the ⸨fix:⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩⸩LORD⸨/fix⸩ hath made it sick⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩⸨i⸩whom⸨/i⸩ he had not ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩given unto them:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, who ⸨i⸩had not given to them⸨/i⸩ any portion.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩divided⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ And the anger of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ this day.⸨marg⸩
