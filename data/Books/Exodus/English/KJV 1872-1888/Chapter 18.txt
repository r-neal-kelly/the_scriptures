⸨i⸩₁ Jethro bringeth to Moses his wife and two sons. ₇ Moses entertaineth him. ₁₃ Jethroʼs counsel is accepted. ₂₇ Jethro departeth.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩When⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Jethro, the priest of Midian, Mosesʼ father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had brought Israel out of Egypt;⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 2⸼ 16⸼
₂ Then Jethro, Mosesʼ father in law, took Zipporah, Mosesʼ wife, after he had sent her back,⸨marg⸩
₃ And her two sons; of which the ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ name of the one ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ˈGershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 2⸼ 22⸼⸨row⸩ˈ That is, ⸨i⸩A stranger there⸨/i⸩.
₄ And the name of the other ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ˈEliezer; for the God of my father, ⸨i⸩said he, was⸨/i⸩ mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:⸨marg⸩ˈ That is, ⸨i⸩My God is an help⸨/i⸩.
₅ And Jethro, Mosesʼ father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:⸨marg⸩
₆ And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.⸨marg⸩
₇ ¶ And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of ⸨i⸩their⸨/i⸩ ⁺welfare; and they came into the tent.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩peace⸨/i⸩.
₈ And Moses told his father in law all that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israelʼs sake, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ all the travail that had ⁺come upon them by the way, and ⸨i⸩how⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ delivered them.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩found them⸨/i⸩.
₉ And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.⸨marg⸩
₁₀ And Jethro said, Blessed ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.⸨marg⸩
₁₁ Now I know that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ greater than all gods: ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly ⸨i⸩he was⸨/i⸩ above them.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 1⸼ ⸨err:10⸼⸩10⸨/err⸩, ⸨err:16⸼⸩16⸨/err⸩, 22⸼⸨row⸩& 5⸼ 7⸼⸨row⸩& 14⸼ 18⸼
₁₂ And Jethro, Mosesʼ father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Mosesʼ father in law before God.⸨marg⸩
₁₃ ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.⸨marg⸩
₁₄ And when Mosesʼ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?⸨marg⸩
₁₅ And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:⸨marg⸩
₁₆ When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between ⁺one and another, and I do make ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ know the statutes of God, and his laws.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a man and his fellow⸨/i⸩.
₁₇ And Mosesʼ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not good.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ ⁺Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with thee: for this thing ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ too heavy for thee; ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Fading thou wilt fade⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ Deut⸼ 1⸼ ⸨err:9⸼⸩·⸼⸨/err⸩
₁₉ Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God‑ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:⸨marg⸩
₂₀ And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.⸨marg⸩
₂₁ Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place ⸨i⸩such⸨/i⸩ over them, ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ rulers of thousands, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:⸨marg⸩
₂₂ And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear ⸨i⸩the burden⸨/i⸩ with thee.⸨marg⸩
₂₃ If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.⸨marg⸩
₂₄ So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.⸨marg⸩
₂₅ And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.⸨marg⸩
₂₆ And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.⸨marg⸩
₂₇ ¶ And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.⸨marg⸩
