⸨cen⸩CHAPTER I⸼
⸨i⸩₁ The children of Israel, after Josephʼs death, do multiply. ₈ The more they are oppressed by a new king, the more they multiply. ₁₅ The godliness of the midwives, in saving the men children alive. ₂₂ Pharaoh commandeth the male children to be cast into the river.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩Now⸨/sc⸩ these ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the names of the ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Gen⸼ 46⸼ 8⸼⸨row⸩chap⸼ 6⸼ 14⸼

₅ And all the souls that came out of the ⁺loins of Jacob were ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt ⸨i⸩already⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩thigh⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Gen⸼ ⸨err:46⸼⸩·⸨/err⸩ 27⸼⸨row⸩Deut⸼ ⸨err:10⸼⸩1·⸨/err⸩ 22⸼
₆ And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.⸨marg⸩
₇ ¶ ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Acts ⸨err:7⸼⸩7⸨/err⸩ 17⸼
₈ Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.⸨marg⸩
₉ And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ more and mightier than we:⸨marg⸩
₁₀ Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩ get them up out of the land.⸨marg⸩
₁₁ Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.⸨marg⸩
₁₂ ⁺But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩And as they afflicted them, so they multiplied, ⸨err:&c⸼⸩&c⸨/err⸩⸨/i⸩
₁₃ And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:⸨marg⸩
₁₄ And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ with rigour.⸨marg⸩
₁₅ ¶ And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:⸨marg⸩
₁₆ And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ upon the stools; if it ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ a daughter, then she shall live.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?⸨marg⸩
₁₉ And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ not as the Egyptian women; for they ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.⸨marg⸩
₂₀ Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.⸨marg⸩
₂₁ And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.⸨marg⸩
₂₂ And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.⸨marg⸩
