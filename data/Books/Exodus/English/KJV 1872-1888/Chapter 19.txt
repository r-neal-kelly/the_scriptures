⸨i⸩₁ The people come to Sinai. ₃ Godʼs message by Moses unto the people out of the mount. ₈ The peopleʼs answer returned again. ₁₀ The people are prepared against the third day. ₁₂ The mountain must not be touched. ₁₆ The fearful presence of God upon the mount.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩In⸨/sc⸩ the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they ⸨i⸩into⸨/i⸩ the wilderness of Sinai.⸨marg⸩
₂ For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come ⸨i⸩to⸨/i⸩ the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.⸨marg⸩
₃ And ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Moses went up unto God, and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Acts 7⸼ 38⸼

₅ Now ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ all the earth ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ mine:⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Deut⸼ 5⸼ 2⸼⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ Deut⸼ 10⸼ 14⸼⸨row⸩Psal⸼ 24⸼ 1⸼

₇ ¶ And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ commanded him.⸨marg⸩
₈ And ⸨i⸩ᶠ⸨/i⸩ all the people answered together, and said, All that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶠ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 24⸼ ⸨fix:3⸼⸩3⸨/fix⸩, 7⸼⸨row⸩Deut⸼ 5⸼ 27⸼⸨row⸩& 26⸼ 17⸼
₉ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
₁₀ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,⸨marg⸩
₁₁ And be ready against the third day: for the third day the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.⸨marg⸩
₁₂ And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, ⸨i⸩that ye⸨/i⸩ go ⸨i⸩not⸨/i⸩ up into the mount, or touch the border of it: ⸨i⸩ᵍ⸨/i⸩ whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵍ⸨/i⸩ Heb⸼ 12⸼ 20⸼
₁₃ There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether ⸨i⸩it be⸨/i⸩ beast or man, it shall not live: when the ⸨sup⸩❘⸨/sup⸩trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❘⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩cornet⸨/i⸩.
₁₄ ¶ And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.⸨marg⸩
₁₅ And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at ⸨i⸩your⸨/i⸩ wives.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ ¶ And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in the camp trembled.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ And ⸨i⸩ʰ⸨/i⸩ mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ʰ⸨/i⸩ Deut⸼ 4⸼ 11⸼
₁₉ And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.⸨marg⸩
₂₀ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ called Moses ⸨i⸩up⸨/i⸩ to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.⸨marg⸩
₂₁ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, Go down, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩charge the people, lest they break through unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ to gaze, and many of them perish.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩contest⸨/i⸩.
₂₂ And let the priests also, which come near to the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, sanctify themselves, lest the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ break forth upon them.⸨marg⸩
₂₃ And Moses said unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.⸨marg⸩
₂₄ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, lest he break forth upon them.⸨marg⸩
₂₅ So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.⸨marg⸩
