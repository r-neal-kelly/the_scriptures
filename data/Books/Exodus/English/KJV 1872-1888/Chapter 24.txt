₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ he said unto Moses, Come up unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off.⸨marg⸩
₂ And Moses alone shall come near the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.⸨marg⸩
₃ ¶ And Moses came and told the people all the words of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ All the words which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath said will we do.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ ⸨fix:19⸼⸩19⸨/fix⸩ 8⸼⸨row⸩& 24⸼ ⸨fix:3⸼⸩3⸨/fix⸩, ⸨fix:7⸼⸩7⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩Deut⸼ 5⸼ 27⸼
₄ And Moses wrote all the words of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.⸨marg⸩
₅ And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
₆ And Moses took half of the blood, and put ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.⸨marg⸩
₇ And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ All that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath said will we do, and be obedient.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ ver⸼ 3⸼
₈ And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ on the people, and said, Behold ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ the blood of the covenant, which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath made with you concerning all these words.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ 1 Pet⸼ 1⸼ 2⸼⸨row⸩Heb⸼ 9⸼ 20⸼
₉ ¶ Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:⸨marg⸩
₁₀ And they saw the God of Israel: and ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ clearness.⸨marg⸩
₁₁ And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.⸨marg⸩
₁₂ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.⸨marg⸩
₁₃ And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.⸨marg⸩
₁₄ And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.⸨marg⸩
₁₅ And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ And the glory of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ And the sight of the glory of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 34⸼ 28⸼⸨row⸩Deut⸼ 9⸼ 9⸼
