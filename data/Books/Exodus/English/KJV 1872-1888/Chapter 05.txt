⸨i⸩₁ Pharaoh chideth Moses and Aaron for their message. ₅ He increaseth the Israelitesʼ task. ₁₅ He checketh their complaints. ₂₀ They cry out upon Moses and Aaron. ₂₂ Moses complaineth to God.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.⸨marg⸩
₂ And Pharaoh said, Who ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, neither will I let Israel go.⸨marg⸩
₃ And they said, ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three daysʼ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ ⸨err:3⸼⸩·⸨/err⸩ 18⸼
₄ And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.⸨marg⸩
₅ And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.⸨marg⸩
₆ And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,⸨marg⸩
₇ Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.⸨marg⸩
₈ And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ⸨i⸩ought⸨/i⸩ thereof: for they ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ sacrifice to our God.⸨marg⸩
₉ ⁺Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Let the work be heavy upon ⸨err:the⸩th⸨/err⸩ men⸨/i⸩.
₁₀ ¶ And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.⸨marg⸩
₁₁ Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.⸨marg⸩
₁₂ So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.⸨marg⸩
₁₃ And the taskmasters hasted ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩, saying, Fulfil your works, ⁺⸨i⸩your⸨/i⸩ daily tasks, as when there was straw.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a ⸨err:matter⸩matte·⸨/err⸩ of a day in his ⸨err:day⸩da·⸨/err⸩⸨/i⸩⸨err:.⸩⸨/err⸩
₁₄ And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaohʼs taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?⸨marg⸩
₁₅ ¶ Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?⸨marg⸩
₁₆ There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ beaten; but the fault ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in thine own people.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ But he said, Ye ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ idle, ⸨i⸩ye are⸨/i⸩ idle: therefore ye say, Let us go ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ do sacrifice to the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ Go therefore now, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.⸨marg⸩
₁₉ And the officers of the children of Israel did see ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ they ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ in evil ⸨i⸩case⸨/i⸩, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ⸨i⸩ought⸨/i⸩ from your bricks of your daily task.⸨marg⸩
₂₀ ¶ And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:⸨marg⸩
₂₁ And they said unto them, The ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour ⁺to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩to stink⸨/i⸩.
₂₂ And Moses returned unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩ evil entreated this people? why ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ it ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ thou hast sent me?⸨marg⸩
₂₃ For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou ⁺delivered thy people at all.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩delivering thou hast not delivered⸨/i⸩⸨err:.⸩⸨/err⸩
