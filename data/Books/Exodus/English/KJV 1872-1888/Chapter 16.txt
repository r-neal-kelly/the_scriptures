₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩
₂ And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:⸨marg⸩
₃ And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.⸨marg⸩
₄ ¶ Then said the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather ⁺a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩the portion of a day in ⸨err:his⸩h·⸨/err⸩ day⸨/i⸩.
₅ And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.⸨marg⸩
₆ And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:⸨marg⸩
₇ And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; for that he heareth your murmurings against the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: and what ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ we, that ye murmur against us?⸨marg⸩
₈ And Moses said, ⸨i⸩This shall be⸨/i⸩⸨err:⸨i⸩, ⸨/i⸩⸩, ⸨/err⸩when the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ we? your murmurings ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ not against us, but against the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
₉ ¶ And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: for he hath heard your murmurings.⸨marg⸩
₁₀ And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ appeared in the cloud.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 13⸼ 21⸼
₁₁ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake unto Moses, saying,⸨marg⸩
₁₂ I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ your God.⸨marg⸩
₁₃ And it came to pass, that at even ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Numb⸼ 11⸼ 31⸼

₁₅ And when the children of Israel saw ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, they said one to another, ˈIt ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ manna: for they wist not what it ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩.

₁₆ ¶ This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the thing which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer ⁺for every man, ⸨i⸩according to⸨/i⸩ the number of your ⁺persons; take ye every man for ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ which ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ in his tents.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩by the poll⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩head⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩souls⸨/i⸩.
₁₇ And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ And when they did mete ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ with an omer, ⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ 2 Cor⸼ ⸨err:8⸼⸩·⸨/err⸩ 15⸼
₁₉ And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.⸨marg⸩
₂₀ Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.⸨marg⸩
₂₁ And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.⸨marg⸩
₂₂ ¶ And it came to pass, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one ⸨i⸩man⸨/i⸩⸨err:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/err⸩and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.⸨marg⸩
₂₃ And he said unto them, This ⸨i⸩is that⸨/i⸩ which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath said, To morrow ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the rest of the holy sabbath unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: bake ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ which ye will bake ⸨i⸩to day⸨/i⸩, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.⸨marg⸩
₂₄ And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.⸨marg⸩
₂₅ And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a sabbath unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: to day ye shall not find it in the field.⸨marg⸩
₂₆ Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, ⸨i⸩which is⸨/i⸩ the sabbath, in it there shall be none.⸨marg⸩
₂₇ ¶ And it came to pass, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ there went out ⸨i⸩some⸨/i⸩ of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.⸨marg⸩
₂₈ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?⸨marg⸩
₂₉ See, for that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.⸨marg⸩
₃₀ So the people rested on the seventh day.⸨marg⸩
₃₁ And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ like wafers ⸨i⸩made⸨/i⸩ with honey.⸨marg⸩
₃₂ ¶ And Moses said, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the thing which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩
₃₃ And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, to be kept for your generations.⸨marg⸩
₃₄ As the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.⸨marg⸩
