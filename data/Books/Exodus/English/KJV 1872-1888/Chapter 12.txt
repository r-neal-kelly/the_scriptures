⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ This month ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ unto you the beginning of months: it ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ the first month of the year to you.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth ⸨i⸩day⸨/i⸩ of this month they shall take to them every man a ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩lamb, according to the house of ⸨i⸩their⸨/i⸩ fathers, a lamb for an house:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩kid⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩of the first year: ye shall take ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ out from the sheep, or from the goats:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩son of a year⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And they shall take of the blood, and strike ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ with bitter ⸨i⸩herbs⸨/i⸩ they shall eat it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast ⸨i⸩with⸨/i⸩ fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And thus shall ye eat it; ⸨i⸩with⸨/i⸩ your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ passover.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩princes⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩to destroy ⸨i⸩you⸨/i⸩, when I smite the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩for a destruction⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And in the first day ⸨i⸩there shall be⸨/i⸩ an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ which every ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩man must eat, that only may be done of you.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩soul⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And ye shall observe ⸨i⸩the feast of⸨/i⸩ unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ ¶ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ In the first ⸨i⸩month⸨/i⸩, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Lev⸼ 23⸼ 5⸼⸨row⸩Numb⸼ ⸨fix:28⸼⸩28⸨/fix⸩ 16⸼
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩kid⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ in the blood that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸩⸨/fix⸩Heb⸼ 11⸼ 28⸼
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ For the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite ⸨i⸩you⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ That ye shall say, It ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the sacrifice of the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And the children of Israel went away, and did as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ ¶ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ And it came to pass, that at midnight the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩e⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 11⸼ 4⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩e⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Wisd⸼ 18⸼ 11⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩house of the pit⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ not a house where ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ not one dead.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, as ye have said.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; they said, We ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ all dead ⸨i⸩men⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩34⸨/sub⸩ And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩dough⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩35⸨/sub⸩ And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩f⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩f⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ ⸨fix:3⸼⸩3⸨/fix⸩ 22⸼⸨row⸩& 11⸼ 2⸼
⸨sub⸩36⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them ⸨i⸩such things as they required⸨/i⸩. And they spoiled the Egyptians.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩37⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩g⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot ⸨i⸩that were⸨/i⸩ men, beside children.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩g⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Numb⸼ 33⸼ 3⸼

⸨sub⸩39⸨/sub⸩ And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩40⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩h⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ four hundred and thirty years.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩h⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Gen⸼ 15⸼ 13⸼⸨row⸩Acts 7⸼ 6⸼⸨row⸩Gal⸼ 3⸼ ⸨fix:17⸼⸩17⸨/fix⸩
