₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,⸨marg⸩
₂ This month ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ unto you the beginning of months: it ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ the first month of the year to you.⸨marg⸩
₃ ¶ Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth ⸨i⸩day⸨/i⸩ of this month they shall take to them every man a ˈlamb, according to the house of ⸨i⸩their⸨/i⸩ fathers, a lamb for an house:⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩kid⸨/i⸩.
₄ And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.⸨marg⸩
₅ Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male ⁺of the first year: ye shall take ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ out from the sheep, or from the goats:⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩son of a year⸨/i⸩.
₆ And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it ⁺in the evening.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩between the two evenings⸨/i⸩.
₇ And they shall take of the blood, and strike ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.⸨marg⸩
₈ And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ with bitter ⸨i⸩herbs⸨/i⸩ they shall eat it.⸨marg⸩
₉ Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast ⸨i⸩with⸨/i⸩ fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.⸨marg⸩
₁₀ And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.⸨marg⸩
₁₁ ¶ And thus shall ye eat it; ⸨i⸩with⸨/i⸩ your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ passover.⸨marg⸩
₁₂ For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the ˈgods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩princes⸨/i⸩.
₁₃ And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you ⁺to destroy ⸨i⸩you⸨/i⸩, when I smite the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩for a destruction⸨/i⸩.
₁₄ And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.⸨marg⸩
₁₅ Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ And in the first day ⸨i⸩there shall be⸨/i⸩ an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ which every ⁺man must eat, that only may be done of you.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩soul⸨/i⸩.
₁₇ And ye shall observe ⸨i⸩the feast of⸨/i⸩ unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ ¶ ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ In the first ⸨i⸩month⸨/i⸩, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Lev⸼ 23⸼ 5⸼⸨row⸩Numb⸼ ⸨fix:28⸼⸩28⸨/fix⸩ 16⸼
₁₉ Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.⸨marg⸩
₂₀ Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.⸨marg⸩
₂₁ ¶ Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a ˈlamb according to your families, and kill the passover.⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩kid⸨/i⸩.
₂₂ ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ in the blood that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ ⸩⸨/fix⸩Heb⸼ 11⸼ 28⸼
₂₃ For the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite ⸨i⸩you⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
₂₄ And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.⸨marg⸩
₂₅ And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.⸨marg⸩
₂₆ ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Josh⸼ 4⸼ 6⸼
₂₇ That ye shall say, It ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the sacrifice of the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.⸨marg⸩
₂₈ And the children of Israel went away, and did as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.⸨marg⸩
₂₉ ¶ ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ And it came to pass, that at midnight the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, ⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in the ⁺dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 11⸼ 4⸼⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ Wisd⸼ 18⸼ 11⸼⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩house of the pit⸨/i⸩.
₃₀ And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ not a house where ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ not one dead.⸨marg⸩
₃₁ ¶ And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, as ye have said.⸨marg⸩
₃₂ Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.⸨marg⸩
₃₃ And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; they said, We ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ all dead ⸨i⸩men⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
₃₄ And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their ˈkneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩dough⸨/i⸩.
₃₅ And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians ⸨i⸩ᶠ⸨/i⸩ jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶠ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ ⸨fix:3⸼⸩3⸨/fix⸩ 22⸼⸨row⸩& 11⸼ 2⸼
₃₆ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them ⸨i⸩such things as they required⸨/i⸩. And they spoiled the Egyptians.⸨marg⸩
₃₇ ¶ And ⸨i⸩ᵍ⸨/i⸩ the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot ⸨i⸩that were⸨/i⸩ men, beside children.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵍ⸨/i⸩ Numb⸼ 33⸼ 3⸼
₃₈ And ⁺a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ very much cattle.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a great mixture⸨/i⸩.
₃₉ And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.⸨marg⸩
₄₀ ¶ Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ⸨i⸩ʰ⸨/i⸩ four hundred and thirty years.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ʰ⸨/i⸩ Gen⸼ 15⸼ 13⸼⸨row⸩Acts 7⸼ 6⸼⸨row⸩Gal⸼ 3⸼ ⸨fix:17⸼⸩17⸨/fix⸩
₄₁ And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ went out from the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩
₄₂ It ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ ⁺a night to be much observed unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ that night of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a night of observations⸨/i⸩.
₄₃ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses and Aaron, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:⸨marg⸩
₄₄ But every manʼs servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.⸨marg⸩
₄₅ A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.⸨marg⸩
₄₆ ⸨i⸩ⁱ⸨/i⸩ In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; ⸨i⸩ᵏ⸨/i⸩ neither shall ye break a bone thereof.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ⁱ⸨/i⸩ Numb⸼ 9⸼ 12⸼⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵏ⸨/i⸩ John 19⸼ 36⸼
₄₇ All the congregation of Israel shall ⁺keep it.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩do it⸨/i⸩.
₄₈ And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.⸨marg⸩
₄₉ One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.⸨marg⸩
₅₀ Thus did all the children of Israel; as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.⸨marg⸩
₅₁ And it came to pass the selfsame day, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.⸨marg⸩
