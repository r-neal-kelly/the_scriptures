⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ Mosesʼ song. ⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ The people want water. ⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ The waters at Marah are bitter. ⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ A tree sweeteneth them. ⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ At Elim are twelve wells, and seventy palm trees.⸨/i⸩

⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sc⸩Then⸨/sc⸩ sang ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Wisd⸼ 1⸼ 20⸼
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ The ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my fatherʼs God, and I will exalt him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ The ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a man of war: the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ his name.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Pharaohʼs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Thy right hand, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, ⸨i⸩which⸨/i⸩ consumed them as stubble.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩destroy them.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩repossess⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ Who ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ like unto thee, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, among the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩gods? who ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful ⸨i⸩in⸨/i⸩ praises, doing wonders?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩mighty ones!⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people ⸨i⸩which⸨/i⸩ thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ The ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ people shall hear, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Deut⸼ 2⸼ 25⸼⸨row⸩Josh⸼ ⸨fix:2⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 9⸼
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, till the people pass over, ⸨i⸩which⸨/i⸩ thou hast purchased.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Deut⸼ ⸨fix:2⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 29⸼⸨row⸩Josh⸼ 2⸼ 5⸼
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, ⸨i⸩in⸨/i⸩ the place, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, ⸨i⸩which⸨/i⸩ thou hast made for thee to dwell in, ⸨i⸩in⸨/i⸩ the Sanctuary, O Lord, ⸨i⸩which⸨/i⸩ thy hands have established.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ The ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall reign for ever and ever.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry ⸨i⸩land⸨/i⸩ in the midst of the sea.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ bitter: therefore the name of it was called ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Marah.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ ⸩⸨/fix⸩That is, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:Bitterness⸩··terness⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And he cried unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shewed him a ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ tree, ⸨i⸩which⸨/i⸩ when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ ⸩⸨/fix⸩Ecclus⸼ ⸨fix:38⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 5⸼
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ that healeth thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ ¶ ⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ And they came to Elim, where ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ twelve wells of water, and three score and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ Numb⸼ 33⸼ 9⸼
