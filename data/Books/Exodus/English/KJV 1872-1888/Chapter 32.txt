⸨i⸩₁ The people, in the absence of Moses, cause Aaron to make a calf. ₇ God is angered thereby. ₁₁ At the intreaty of Moses he is appeased. ₁₅ Moses cometh down with the tables. ₁₉ He breaketh them. ₂₀ He destroyeth the calf. ₂₂ Aaronʼs excuse for himself. ₂₅ Moses causeth the idolaters to be slain. ₃₀ He prayeth for the people.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for ⸨i⸩as for⸨/i⸩ this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Acts 7⸼ 40⸼

₁₅ ¶ And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ in his hand: the tables ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ they written.⸨marg⸩

₂₁ And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?⸨marg⸩
₂₂ And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they ⸨i⸩are set⸨/i⸩ on mischief.⸨marg⸩
₂₃ For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for ⸨i⸩as for⸨/i⸩ this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.⸨marg⸩
₂₄ And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ off. So they gave ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.⸨marg⸩

₂₇ And he said unto them, Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.⸨marg⸩

₃₁ And Moses returned unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.⸨marg⸩
₃₂ Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.⸨marg⸩
