₇ Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.⸨marg⸩
₈ ¶ And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, ⸨i⸩This is done⸨/i⸩ because of that ⸨i⸩which⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.⸨marg⸩
₉ And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ brought thee out of Egypt.⸨marg⸩

₁₅ And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.⸨marg⸩
