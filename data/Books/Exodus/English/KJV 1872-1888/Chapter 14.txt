⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And they said unto Moses, Because ⸨i⸩there were⸨/i⸩ no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?
