₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake unto Moses, saying,⸨marg⸩
₂ Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Pi‑hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal‑zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Numb⸼ 33⸼ 7⸼
₃ For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.⸨marg⸩
₄ And I will harden Pharaohʼs heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩. And they did so.⸨marg⸩
₅ ¶ And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?⸨marg⸩
₆ And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:⸨marg⸩
₇ And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.⸨marg⸩
₈ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.⸨marg⸩
₉ But the ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi‑hahiroth, before Baal‑zephon.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Josh⸼ ⸨fix:24⸼⸩24⸨/fix⸩ 6⸼⸨row⸩1 Mac⸼ 4⸼ 9⸼
₁₀ ¶ And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
₁₁ And they said unto Moses, Because ⸨i⸩there were⸨/i⸩ no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?⸨marg⸩
₁₂ ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For ⸨i⸩it had been⸨/i⸩ better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 6⸼ ⸨fix:9⸼⸩·⸼⸨/fix⸩
₁₃ ¶ And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, which he will shew to you to day: ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩for whereas you have seen the Egyptians to day, &c⸼⸨/i⸩

₁₅ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:⸨marg⸩
₁₆ But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ⸨i⸩ground⸨/i⸩ through the midst of the sea.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ And the Egyptians shall know that I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.⸨marg⸩
₁₉ ¶ And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:⸨marg⸩
₂₀ And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness ⸨i⸩to them⸨/i⸩, but it gave light by night ⸨i⸩to these⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩so that the one came not near the other all the night.⸨marg⸩
₂₁ And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ caused the sea to go ⸨i⸩back⸨/i⸩ by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry ⸨i⸩land⸨/i⸩, and the waters were ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ divided.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ Josh⸼ ⸨fix:4⸼⸩4⸨/fix⸩ 23⸼⸨row⸩Psal⸼ 114⸼ 3⸼

₂₃ ¶ And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ all Pharaohʼs horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.⸨marg⸩
₂₄ And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,⸨marg⸩
₂₅ And took off their chariot wheels, ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ fighteth for them against the Egyptians.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩made them to go heavily⸨/i⸩.
₂₆ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.⸨marg⸩
₂₇ And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩shook off⸨/i⸩.
