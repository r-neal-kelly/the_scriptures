⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ Moses is born, ⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ and in an ark cast into the flags. ⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ He is found, and brought up by Pharaohʼs daughter. ⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ He slayeth an Egyptian. ⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ He reproveth an Hebrew. ⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ He fleeth into Midian. ⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ He marrieth Zipporah. ⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ Gershom is born. ⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ God respecteth the Israelitesʼ cry.⸨/i⸩

⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ there went ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ a man of the house of Levi, and took ⸨i⸩to wife⸨/i⸩ a daughter of Levi.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 6⸼ 20⸼⸨row⸩Numb⸼ 26⸼ 59⸼
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he ⸨i⸩was a⸨/i⸩ goodly ⸨i⸩child⸨/i⸩, she ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ hid him three months.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Acts 7⸼ ⸨fix:20⸼⸩20⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩Heb⸼ 11⸼ 23⸼
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ in the flags by the riverʼs brink.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash ⸨i⸩herself⸨/i⸩ at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And when she had opened ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This ⸨i⸩is one⸨/i⸩ of the Hebrewsʼ children.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ Then said his sister to Pharaohʼs daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And Pharaohʼs daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the childʼs mother.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And Pharaohʼs daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give ⸨i⸩thee⸨/i⸩ thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaohʼs daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That is, ⸨i⸩Drawn out⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Who made thee ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a man, a prince⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ Now the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew ⸨i⸩water⸨/i⸩, and filled the troughs to water their fatherʼs flock.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩prince⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How ⸨i⸩is it that⸨/i⸩ ye are come so soon to day?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew ⸨i⸩water⸨/i⸩ enough for us, and watered the flock.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto his daughters, And where ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ he? why ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ it ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And she bare ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ a son, and he called his name ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:chap⸼⸩chap⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:18⸼⸩1·⸨/fix⸩ 3⸼
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Gen⸼ 15⸼ 14⸼⸨row⸩& 46⸼ 4⸼
