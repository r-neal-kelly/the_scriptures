⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ a ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 32⸼ 9⸼⸨row⸩Deut⸼ 9⸼ 13⸼
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ For the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ every one which sought the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ without the camp.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ all the people rose up, and stood every man ⸨i⸩at⸨/i⸩ his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood ⸨i⸩at⸨/i⸩ the door of the tabernacle, and ⸨i⸩the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩⸨/i⸩ talked with Moses.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand ⸨i⸩at⸨/i⸩ the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man ⸨i⸩in⸨/i⸩ his tent door.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Moses said unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy people.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And he said, My presence shall go ⸨i⸩with thee⸨/i⸩, and I will give thee rest.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto him, If thy presence go not ⸨i⸩with me⸨/i⸩, carry us not up hence.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? ⸨i⸩is it⸨/i⸩ not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ upon the face of the earth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ before thee; ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Rom⸼ 9⸼ 15⸼
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, Behold, ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.⸨marg⸩
