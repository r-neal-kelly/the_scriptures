₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and pitched in Rephidim: and ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ no water for the people to drink.⸨marg⸩
₂ Wherefore ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩?⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Numb⸼ ⸨fix:20⸼⸩··⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:3⸼⸩4⸼⸨/fix⸩
₃ And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?⸨marg⸩
₄ And Moses cried unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.⸨marg⸩
₅ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 7⸼ 20⸼
₆ ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.

₇ And he called the name of the place ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Massah, and ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, saying, Is the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ among us, or not?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That is, ⸨i⸩Tentation⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That is, ⸨i⸩Chiding⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩Strife⸨/i⸩.

₁₀ So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.⸨marg⸩
₁₁ And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.⸨marg⸩
₁₂ But Mosesʼ hands ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ heavy; and they took a stone, and put ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.⸨marg⸩
₁₃ And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.⸨marg⸩
₁₄ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, Write this ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ a memorial in a book, and rehearse ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ in the ears of Joshua: for ⸨i⸩ᶠ⸨/i⸩ I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶠ⸨/i⸩ Numb⸼ 24⸼ 20⸼⸨row⸩1 Sam⸼ 15⸼ 3⸼
