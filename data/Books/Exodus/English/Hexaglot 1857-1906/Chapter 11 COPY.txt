⸨cen⸩CHAPTER XI⸼

1 ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague ⸨i⸩more⸨/i⸩ upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let ⸨i⸩you⸨/i⸩ go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.
3 And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaohʼs servants, and in the sight of the people.
4 And Moses said, Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:
5 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.
6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.
7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.
8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.
9 And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hardened Pharaohʼs heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
