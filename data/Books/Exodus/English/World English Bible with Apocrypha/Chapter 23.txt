⸨in⸩¹ “You shall not spread a false report. Donʼt join your hand with the wicked to be a malicious witness.
⸨in⸩² “You shall not follow a crowd to do evil. You shall not testify in court to side with a multitude to pervert justice. ³ You shall not favor a poor man in his cause.
⸨in⸩⁴ “If you meet your enemyʼs ox or his donkey going astray, you shall surely bring it back to him again. ⁵ If you see the donkey of him who hates you fallen down under his burden, donʼt leave him. You shall surely help him with it.

⸨in⸩⁷ “Keep far from a false charge, and donʼt kill the innocent and righteous; for I will not justify the wicked.

⸨in⸩²⁰ “Behold, I send an angel before you, to keep you by the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. ²¹ Pay attention to him, and listen to his voice. Donʼt provoke him, for he will not pardon your disobedience, for my name is in him. ²² But if you indeed listen to his voice, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and an adversary to your adversaries. ²³ For my angel shall go before you, and bring you in to the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off. ²⁴ You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor follow their practices, but you shall utterly overthrow them and demolish their pillars. ²⁵ You shall serve Yahweh your God, and he will bless your bread and your water, and I will take sickness away from among you. ²⁶ No one will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will fulfill the number of your days. ²⁷ I will send my terror before you, and will confuse all the people to whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you. ²⁸ I will send the hornet before you, which will drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before you. ²⁹ I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the animals of the field multiply against you. ³⁰ Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased and inherit the land. ³¹ I will set your border from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you. ³² You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. ³³ They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me, for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.”
