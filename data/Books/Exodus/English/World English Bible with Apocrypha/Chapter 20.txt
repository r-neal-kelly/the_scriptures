⸨in⸩²⁰ Moses said to the people, “Donʼt be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that his fear may be before you, that you wonʼt sin.” ²¹ The people stayed at a distance, and Moses came near to the thick darkness where God was.
⸨in⸩²² Yahweh said to Moses, “This is what you shall tell the children of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. ²³ You shall most certainly not make gods of silver or gods of gold for yourselves to be alongside me. ²⁴ You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you. ²⁵ If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of cut stones; for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it. ²⁶ You shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.’
