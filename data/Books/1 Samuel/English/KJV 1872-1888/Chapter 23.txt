⸨size:0.85⸩⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ David, enquiring of the ⸨fix:⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩⸩Lord⸨/fix⸩ by Abiathar, rescueth Keilah. ⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ God shewing him the coming of Saul, and the treachery of the Keilites, he escapeth from Keilah. ⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ In Ziph Jonathan cometh and comforteth him. ⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ The Ziphites discover him to Saul. ⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ At Maon he is rescued from Saul by the invasion of the Philistines. ⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ He dwelleth at En‑gedi.⸨/i⸩⸨/size⸩

⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩Then⸨/sc⸩ they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ Therefore David enquired of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And Davidʼs men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Then David enquired of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ yet again. And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ fled to David to Keilah, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ he came down ⸨i⸩with⸨/i⸩ an ephod in his hand.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 22⸼ 20⸼
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ Then said David, O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, He will come down.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ Then said David, Will the men of Keilah ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, They will deliver ⸨i⸩thee⸨/i⸩ up.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩shut up⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Then David and his men, ⸨i⸩which were⸨/i⸩ about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Jonathan Saulʼs son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And they two made a covenant before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩on the south of ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Jeshimon?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩He·⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩on the right hand⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩the wilderness?⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ to deliver him into the kingʼs hand.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And Saul said, Blessed ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ ye of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; for ye have compassion on me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩haunt is, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ who hath seen him there: for it is told me ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ he dealeth very subtilly.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩foot shall ⸨fix:be⸩·e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ Saul also and his men went to seek ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩. And they told David: wherefore he came down ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ ¶ But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩invaded the land.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩He·⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩spread themselves upon⸨/i⸩, &c⸼
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Sela‑hammahlekoth.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That is, ⸨i⸩The rock of divisions⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En‑gedi.⸨marg⸩
