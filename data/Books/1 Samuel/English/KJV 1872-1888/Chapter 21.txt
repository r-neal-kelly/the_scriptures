⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩Then⸨/sc⸩ came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou alone, and no man with thee?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed ⸨i⸩my⸨/i⸩ servants to such and such a place.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore what is under thine hand? give ⸨i⸩me⸨/i⸩ five ⸨i⸩loaves of⸨/i⸩ bread in mine hand, or what there is ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩present.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩found⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And the priest answered David, and said, ⸨i⸩There is⸨/i⸩ no common bread under mine hand, but there is ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ex⸼ 25⸼ 30⸼⸨row⸩⸨fix:Lev⸼⸩L·v⸼⸨/fix⸩ 24⸼ 5⸼⸨row⸩Matt⸼ 12⸼ 4⸼
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women ⸨i⸩have been⸨/i⸩ kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and ⸨i⸩the bread is⸨/i⸩ in a manner common, ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩especially when this day there is⸨/i⸩ other ⸨i⸩sanctified in the vessel⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ So the priest gave him hallowed ⸨i⸩bread⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ Now a certain man of the servants of Saul ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ there that day, detained before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; and his name ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that ⸨i⸩belonged⸨/i⸩ to Saul.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the kingʼs business required haste.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ the valley of Elah, behold, it ⸨i⸩is here⸨/i⸩ wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩for ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ no other save that here. And David said, ⸨i⸩There is⸨/i⸩ none like that; give it me.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 17⸼ 2⸼
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And the servants of Achish said unto him, ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 18⸼ 7⸼⸨row⸩& ⸨fix:29⸼⸩2·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 5⸼⸨row⸩Ecclus⸼ 47⸼ 6⸼
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩made marks⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩is mad: wherefore ⸨i⸩then⸨/i⸩ have ye brought him to me?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩playeth the mad man⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this ⸨i⸩fellow⸨/i⸩ to play the mad man in my presence? shall this ⸨i⸩fellow⸨/i⸩ come into my house?⸨marg⸩
