⸨size:0.85⸩⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ By occasion of the ill government of Samuelʼs sons, the Israelites ask a king. ⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Samuel praying in grief, is comforted by God: ⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ He telleth the manner of a king. ⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ God willeth Samuel to yield unto the importunity of the people.⸨/i⸩⸨/size⸩

⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: ⸨i⸩they were⸨/i⸩ judges in Beer‑sheba.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ took bribes, and perverted judgment.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Deu⸼ 16⸼ 19⸼
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Then all the elders of ⸨fix:Israel⸩Israe⸨/fix⸩⸨fix: ⸩. ⸨/fix⸩gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ make us a king to judge us like all the nations.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Hos⸼ 13⸼ 10⸼⸨row⸩Acts 13⸼ 21⸼
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ But the thing ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩was evil in the eyes of Samuel⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩hearken unto their voice: ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩obey⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩notwithstanding, when thou hast solemnly protested against them, then thou shalt shew⸨/i⸩, &c⸼
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Samuel told all the words of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ unto the people that asked of him a king.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ for himself, for his chariots, and ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ his horsemen; and ⸨i⸩some⸨/i⸩ shall run before his chariots.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and ⸨i⸩will set them⸨/i⸩ to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And he will take your daughters ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ confectionaries, and ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ cooks, and ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ bakers.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ the best ⸨i⸩of them⸨/i⸩, and give ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ to his servants.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩officers, and to his servants.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨fix:✝⸩·⸨/fix⸩⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩eunuchs⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ to his work.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ will not hear you in that day.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.⸨marg⸩
