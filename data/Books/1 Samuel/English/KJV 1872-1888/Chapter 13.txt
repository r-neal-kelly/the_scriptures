⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩Saul⸨/sc⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩the son of one year in his reigning⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ Saul chose him three thousand ⸨i⸩men⸨/i⸩ of Israel; ⸨i⸩whereof⸨/i⸩ two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth‑el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Geba, and the Philistines heard ⸨i⸩of it⸨/i⸩. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩The hill⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And all Israel heard say ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ Israel also ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩did stink⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth‑aven.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (⸨fix:for⸩·or⸨/fix⸩ the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨i⸩some of⸨/i⸩ the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ yet in Gilgal, and all the people ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩followed him trembling.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩trembled after him⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel ⸨i⸩had appointed⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ 10⸼ 8⸼
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩salute him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩bless him⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ thou camest not within the days appointed, and ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩made supplication unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:intreated⸩·ntreated⸨/fix⸩ the face⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath commanded him ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ captain over his people, because thou hast not kept ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ commanded thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people ⸨i⸩that were⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩present with him, about six hundred men.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩found⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people ⸨i⸩that were⸨/i⸩ present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way ⸨i⸩that leadeth to⸨/i⸩ Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And another company turned the way ⸨i⸩to⸨/i⸩ Beth‑horon: and another company turned ⸨i⸩to⸨/i⸩ the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ swords or spears:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his ax, and his mattock.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ Yet they had ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩to sharpen the goads.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a file with mouths⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩to set⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩standing camp⸨/i⸩.
