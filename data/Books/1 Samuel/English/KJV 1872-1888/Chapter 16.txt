⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth‑lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, he will kill me. And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, Take an heifer ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩in thine hand⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ whom I name unto thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And Samuel did that which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ spake, and came to Beth‑lehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩meeting⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ anointed ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ before him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ But the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for ⸨i⸩the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ seeth⸨/i⸩ not as man seeth; for man looketh on the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩outward appearance, but the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ looketh on the ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ heart.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩eyes⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chr⸼ 28⸼ 9⸼⸨row⸩Ps⸼ 7⸼ 9⸼⸨row⸩Jer⸼ 11⸼ 20⸼⸨row⸩& 17⸼ 10⸼⸨row⸩& 20⸼ 12⸼
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ chosen this.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ chosen this.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ hath not chosen these.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all ⸨i⸩thy⸨/i⸩ children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Send and fetch him: for we will not sit ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩down till he come hither.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 ⸨fix:Sam⸼⸩Sam⸨/fix⸩ 7⸼ 8⸼⸨row⸩Ps⸼ 78⸼ 70⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩round⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And he sent, and brought him in. Now he ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ruddy, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ withal ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, Arise, anoint him: for this ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ he.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩fair of eyes⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ ¶ But the Spirit of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩troubled him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩terrified⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And Saulʼs servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ Let our lord now command thy servants, ⸨i⸩which are⸨/i⸩ before thee, to seek out a man, ⸨i⸩who is⸨/i⸩ a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ to me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth‑lehemite, ⸨i⸩that is⸨/i⸩ cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩matters, and a comely person, and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩speech⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with the sheep.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And Jesse took an ass ⸨i⸩laden⸨/i⸩ with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ by David his son unto Saul.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, when the ⸨i⸩evil⸨/i⸩ spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.⸨marg⸩
