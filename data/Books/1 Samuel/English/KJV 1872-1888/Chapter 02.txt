⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, mine horn is exalted in the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩There is⸨/i⸩ none holy as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: for ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ none beside thee: neither ⸨i⸩is there⸨/i⸩ any rock like our God.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let ⸨i⸩not⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩hard⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ The bows of the mighty men ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩They that were⸨/i⸩ full have hired out themselves for bread; and ⸨i⸩they that were⸨/i⸩ hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ He ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ raiseth up the poor out of the dust, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩, and he hath set the world upon them.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:b⸩c⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ps⸼ ⸨fix:113⸼⸩11·⸼⸨/fix⸩ 7⸼
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ The adversaries of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall be broken to pieces; ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩d⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:c⸩·⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ch⸼ ⸨fix:7⸼⸩7⸨/fix⸩ 10⸼
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ before Eli the priest.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Now the sons of Eli ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ sons of Belial; they knew not the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And the priestʼs custom with the people ⸨i⸩was, that⸨/i⸩, when any man offered sacrifice, the priestʼs servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And he struck ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Also before they burnt the fat, the priestʼs servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨i⸩if⸨/i⸩ any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩presently, and ⸨i⸩then⸨/i⸩ take ⸨i⸩as much⸨/i⸩ as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, ⸨i⸩Nay; ⸨/i⸩but thou shalt give ⸨i⸩it me⸨/i⸩ now: and if not, I will take ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ by force.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸩·⸨/fix⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩as on the day⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: for men abhorred the offering of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ ¶ But Samuel ministered before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, ⸨i⸩being⸨/i⸩ a child, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ girded with a linen ⸨fix:ephod⸩eph·d⸨/fix⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:d⸩e⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ex⸼ 28⸼ 4⸼
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ give thee seed of this woman for the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩loan which is lent to the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩. And they went unto their own home.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩petition which she asked⸨/i⸩, &c⸼
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩assembled ⸨i⸩at⸨/i⸩ the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:assembled⸩as·embled⸨/fix⸩ by troops⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩I hear evil words of you⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ Nay, my sons; for ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ no good report that I hear: ye make the ⸨sc⸩Lordʼs⸨/sc⸩ people ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩to transgress.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩to cry out⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ would slay them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and also with men.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaohʼs house?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:e⸩a⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Lev⸼ 10⸼ 14⸼
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded ⸨i⸩in my⸨/i⸩ habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ Wherefore the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Israel saith, I said indeed ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy fatherʼs house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ And thou shalt see ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩an enemy ⸨i⸩in my⸨/i⸩ habitation, in all ⸨i⸩the wealth⸨/i⸩ which ⸨i⸩God⸨/i⸩ shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩the affliction of the tabernacle, for all the wealth which God would have given Israel⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ And the man of thine, ⸨i⸩whom⸨/i⸩ I shall not cut off from mine altar, ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩in the ⸨fix:flower⸩flowe·⸨/fix⸩ of their age.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩men⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩35⸨/sub⸩ And I will raise me up a faithful priest, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ shall do according to ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.⸨marg⸩
