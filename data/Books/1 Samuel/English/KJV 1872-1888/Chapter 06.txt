⸨size:0.85⸩⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ After seven months the Philistines take counsel how to send back the ark. ⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ They bring it on a new cart with an offering unto Beth‑shemesh. ⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ The people are smitten for looking into the ark. ⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ They send to them of Kirjath‑jearim to fetch it.⸨/i⸩⸨/size⸩

⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the ark of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was in the country of the Philistines seven months.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ Then said they, What ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, ⸨i⸩according to⸨/i⸩ the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ on ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩you all, and on your lords.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩wonderfully among them, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ did they not let ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩the people go, and they departed?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:reproachfully⸩reproach·ully⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ex⸼ 12⸼ 31⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And take the ark of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth‑shemesh, ⸨i⸩then⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ not his hand ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ smote us; it ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ a chance ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ happened to us.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And they laid the ark of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth‑shemesh, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside ⸨i⸩to⸨/i⸩ the right hand or ⸨i⸩to⸨/i⸩ the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth‑shemesh.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨i⸩they of⸨/i⸩ Beth‑shemesh ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth‑shemite, and stood there, where ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And the Levites took down the ark of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and the coffer that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ with it, wherein the jewels of gold ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩, and put ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ on the great stone: and the men of Beth‑shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, they returned to Ekron the same day.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And these ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the golden emerods which the Philistines returned ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ a trespass offering unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And the golden mice, ⸨i⸩according to⸨/i⸩ the number of all the cities of the Philistines ⸨i⸩belonging⸨/i⸩ to the five lords, ⸨i⸩both⸨/i⸩ of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩great ⸨i⸩stone of⸨/i⸩ Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: ⸨i⸩which stone remaineth⸨/i⸩ unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Beth‑shemite.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩great stone⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And he smote the men of Beth‑shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had smitten ⸨i⸩many⸨/i⸩ of the people with a great slaughter.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And the men of Beth‑shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God? and to whom shall he go up from us?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath‑jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; come ye down, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ fetch it up to you.⸨marg⸩
