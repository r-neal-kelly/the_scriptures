⸨size:0.85⸩⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ How the word of the ⸨fix:⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩⸩Lord⸨/fix⸩ was first revealed to Samuel. ⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ God telleth Samuel the destruction of Eliʼs house. ⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Samuel, though loth, telleth Eli the vision. ⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Samuel groweth in credit.⸨/i⸩⸨/size⸩

⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the child Samuel ministered unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ before Eli. And the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was precious in those days; ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ no open vision.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass at that time, when Eli ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ he could not see;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, where the ark of God ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩, and Samuel was laid down ⸨i⸩to sleep⸨/i⸩⸨fix:;⸩⸨i⸩;⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ That the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ called Samuel: and he answered, Here ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ I.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Now Samuel did not yet know the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, neither was the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ yet revealed unto him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩Thus⸨/i⸩ did ⸨i⸩Samuel, before he knew the ⸨fix:⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩⸩LORD⸨/fix⸩, and before the word of the ⸨fix:⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩⸩LORD⸨/fix⸩ was revealed unto him⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had called the child.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ every one that heareth it shall tingle.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩⸨fix:a⸩b⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 Kin⸼ 21⸼ 12⸼
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ In that day I will perform against Eli all ⸨i⸩things⸨/i⸩ which I have spoken concerning his house: ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩when I begin, I will also make an end.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩beginning and ending⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eliʼs house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ I.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And he said, What ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the thing that ⸨i⸩the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩⸨/i⸩ hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ not from me: God do so to thee, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩more also, if thou hide ⸨i⸩any⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩so add⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩word⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And Samuel told him ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: let him do what seemeth him good.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩all the things⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩words⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Samuel grew, and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And all Israel from Dan even to Beer‑sheba knew that Samuel ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩established ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ a prophet of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩faithful⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ appeared again in Shiloh: for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
