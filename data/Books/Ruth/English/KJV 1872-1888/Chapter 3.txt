⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩Then⸨/sc⸩ Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And now ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩lift up the clothes that are on his feet⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩took hold on⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Who ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou? And she answered, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩a near kinsman.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩one that hath right to ⸨fix:redeem⸩redee·⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Blessed ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ thou of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, my daughter: ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩city of my people doth know that thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ a virtuous woman.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩gate⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And now it is true that I ⸨i⸩am thy⸨/i⸩ near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsmanʼs part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ liveth: lie down until the morning.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Also he said, Bring the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩vail that ⸨i⸩thou hast⸨/i⸩ upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six ⸨i⸩measures⸨/i⸩ of barley, and laid ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ on her: and she went into the city.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩sheet⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩apron⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And she said, These six ⸨i⸩measures⸨/i⸩ of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.⸨marg⸩
