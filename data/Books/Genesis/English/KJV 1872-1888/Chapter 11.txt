₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ the whole earth was of one ⁺language, and of one ⁺speech.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Wisd⸼ ⸨fix:10⸼⸩10⸨/fix⸩ 5⸼⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩lip⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩words⸨/i⸩.
₂ And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.⸨marg⸩

₄ And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top ⸨i⸩may reach⸨/i⸩ unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.⸨marg⸩
₅ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.⸨marg⸩
₆ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, Behold, the people ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.⸨marg⸩
₇ Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one anotherʼs speech.⸨marg⸩
₈ So the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.⸨marg⸩
₉ Therefore is the name of it called ˈBabel; because the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:ˈ ⸩⸨/fix⸩That is, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:confusion⸩onfusion⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
