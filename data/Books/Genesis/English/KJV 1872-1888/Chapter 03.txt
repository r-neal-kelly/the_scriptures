⸨size:0.85⸩⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ The serpent deceiveth Eve. ⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Manʼs shameful fall. ⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ God arraigneth them. ⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ The serpent is cursed. ⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ The promised seed. ⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ The punishment of mankind. ⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ Their first clothing. ⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ Their casting out of paradise.⸨/i⸩⸨/size⸩

⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sc⸩Now⸨/sc⸩ the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God had made. And he said unto the woman, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Yea, because, &c⸼⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ But of the fruit of the tree which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 2 Cor⸼ 11⸼ 3⸼⸨row⸩1 Tim⸼ 2⸼ 14⸼
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And when the woman saw that the tree ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ good for food, and that it ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make ⸨i⸩one⸨/i⸩ wise, she took of the fruit thereof, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a desire⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Ecclus⸼ 25⸼ 16⸼⸨row⸩1 Tim⸼ 2⸼ 14⸼
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩aprons.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩things to gird ⸨fix:about⸩abou⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And they heard the voice of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God walking in the garden in the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God amongst the trees of the garden.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩wind⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ naked; and I hid myself.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Who told thee that thou ⸨i⸩wast⸨/i⸩ naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God said unto the woman, What ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; and it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩to thy husband, and he shall ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ rule over thee.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩subject to thy husband⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Cor⸼ 14⸼ 34⸼
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ it all the days of thy life;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ Thorns also and thistles shall it ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩He⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩cause to bud⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩, and unto dust shalt thou return.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And Adam called his wifeʼs name ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Eve; because she was the mother of all living.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩Heb⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩Chavah⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ Unto Adam also and to his wife did the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God make coats of skins, and clothed them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ Therefore the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.⸨marg⸩
