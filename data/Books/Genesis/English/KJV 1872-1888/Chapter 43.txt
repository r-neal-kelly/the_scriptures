⸨cen⸩CHAPTER XLIII⸼
⸨i⸩₁ Jacob is hardly persuaded to send Benjamin. ₁₅ Joseph entertaineth his brethren. ₃₁ He maketh them a feast.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the famine ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ sore in the land.
₂ And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
₃ And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man ⁺did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ brother ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ with you.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 42⸼ 20⸼⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩protesting he protested⸨/i⸩.
₄ If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
₅ But if thou wilt not send ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ with you.
₆ And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩ ill with me, ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
₇ And they said, The man ⁺asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ your father yet alive? have ye ⸨i⸩another⸨/i⸩ brother? and we told him according to the ⁺tenor of these words: ⁺could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩asking he asked us⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩mouth⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩knowing could we know⸨/i⸩.
₈ And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ also our little ones.
₉ I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 44⸼ 32⸼
₁₀ For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned ˈthis second time.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩twice by this⸨/i⸩.
₁₁ And their father Israel said unto them, If ⸨i⸩it must be⸨/i⸩ so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
₁₂ And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ again in your hand; peradventure it ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ an oversight:
₁₃ Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
₁₄ And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. ˈIf I be bereaved ⸨i⸩of my children⸨/i⸩, I am bereaved.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩And I, as I have been, &c⸼⸨/i⸩
₁₅ ¶ And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
₁₆ And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring ⸨i⸩these⸨/i⸩ men home, and ⁺slay, and make ready; for ⸨i⸩these⸨/i⸩ men shall ⁺dine with me at noon.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨err:kill⸩····⸨/err⸩ a ⸨err:killing⸩kill···⸨/err⸩⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩eat⸨/i⸩.
₁₇ And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Josephʼs house.
₁₈ And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Josephʼs house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may ⁺seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨err:roll⸩r··l⸨/err⸩ himself upon us⸨/i⸩.
₁₉ And they came near to the steward of Josephʼs house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
₂₀ And said, O sir, ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ ⁺we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 42⸼ 3⸼⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨err:coming⸩···ing⸨/err⸩ ⸨err:down⸩····⸨/err⸩ ⸨err:we⸩··⸨/err⸩ came ⸨err:down⸩····⸨/err⸩⸨/i⸩.
₂₁ And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, ⸨i⸩every⸨/i⸩ manʼs money ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
₂₂ And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
₂₃ And he said, Peace ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: ⁺I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩your money came to me⸨/i⸩.
₂₄ And the man brought the men into Josephʼs house, and ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ gave ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 18⸼ 4⸼⸨row⸩& 24⸼ 32⸼
₂₅ And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
₂₆ ¶ And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
₂₇ And he asked them of ⸨i⸩their⸨/i⸩ ⁺welfare, and said, ⁺⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ he yet alive?⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩peace⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ Is there ⸨i⸩peace to your father⸨/i⸩.
₂₈ And they answered, Thy servant our father ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in good health, he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.
₂₉ And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his motherʼs son, and said, ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
₃₀ And Joseph made haste, for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought ⸨i⸩where⸨/i⸩ to weep; and he entered into ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ chamber, and wept there.
₃₁ And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
₃₂ And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ an abomination unto the Egyptians.
₃₃ And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.
₃₄ And he took ⸨i⸩and sent⸨/i⸩ messes unto them from before him: but Benjaminʼs mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and ⁺were merry with him.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩they drank largely⸨/i⸩.
