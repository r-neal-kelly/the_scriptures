⸨i⸩₁ Jacob is hardly persuaded to send Benjamin. ₁₅ Joseph entertaineth his brethren. ₃₁ He maketh them a feast.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the famine ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ sore in the land.⸨marg⸩
₂ And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.⸨marg⸩
₃ And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ brother ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ with you.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩protesting he protested⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 42⸼ 20⸼
₄ If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:⸨marg⸩
₅ But if thou wilt not send ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ with you.⸨marg⸩
₆ And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩ ill with me, ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?⸨marg⸩
₇ And they said, The man ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ your father yet alive? have ye ⸨i⸩another⸨/i⸩ brother? and we told him according to the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩tenor of these words: ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩asking he asked us⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩mouth⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩knowing could we know⸨/i⸩.
₈ And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ also our little ones.⸨marg⸩
₉ I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 44⸼ 32⸼
₁₀ For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩this second time.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩twice by this⸨/i⸩.
₁₁ And their father Israel said unto them, If ⸨i⸩it must be⸨/i⸩ so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:⸨marg⸩
₁₂ And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ again in your hand; peradventure it ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ an oversight:⸨marg⸩
₁₃ Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:⸨marg⸩
₁₄ And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩If I be bereaved ⸨i⸩of my children⸨/i⸩, I am bereaved.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩And I, as I have been, &c⸼⸨/i⸩
₁₅ ¶ And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring ⸨i⸩these⸨/i⸩ men home, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩slay, and make ready; for ⸨i⸩these⸨/i⸩ men shall ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩dine with me at noon.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:kill⸩····⸨/fix⸩ a ⸨fix:killing⸩kill···⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩eat⸨/i⸩.
₁₇ And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Josephʼs house.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Josephʼs house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:roll⸩r··l⸨/fix⸩ himself upon us⸨/i⸩.
₁₉ And they came near to the steward of Josephʼs house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,⸨marg⸩
₂₀ And said, O sir, ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 42⸼ 3⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:coming⸩···ing⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:down⸩····⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:we⸩··⸨/fix⸩ came ⸨fix:down⸩····⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
₂₁ And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, ⸨i⸩every⸨/i⸩ manʼs money ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.⸨marg⸩
₂₂ And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.⸨marg⸩
₂₃ And he said, Peace ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩your money came to me⸨/i⸩.
₂₄ And the man brought the men into Josephʼs house, and ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ gave ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 18⸼ 4⸼⸨row⸩& 24⸼ 32⸼
₂₅ And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.⸨marg⸩
₂₆ ¶ And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.⸨marg⸩
₂₇ And he asked them of ⸨i⸩their⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩welfare, and said, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ he yet alive?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩peace⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ Is there ⸨i⸩peace to your father⸨/i⸩.
₂₈ And they answered, Thy servant our father ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in good health, he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.⸨marg⸩
₂₉ And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his motherʼs son, and said, ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.⸨marg⸩
₃₀ And Joseph made haste, for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought ⸨i⸩where⸨/i⸩ to weep; and he entered into ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ chamber, and wept there.⸨marg⸩
₃₁ And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.⸨marg⸩
₃₂ And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ an abomination unto the Egyptians.⸨marg⸩
₃₃ And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.⸨marg⸩
₃₄ And he took ⸨i⸩and sent⸨/i⸩ messes unto them from before him: but Benjaminʼs mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩were merry with him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩they drank largely⸨/i⸩.
