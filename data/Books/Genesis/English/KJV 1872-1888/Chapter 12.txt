⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sc⸩Now⸨/sc⸩ the ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy fatherʼs house, unto a land that I will shew thee:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Acts 7⸼ 3⸼
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 18⸼ 18⸼⸨row⸩& 22⸼ 18⸼⸨row⸩Acts 3⸼ 25⸼⸨row⸩Gal⸼ 3⸼ 8⸼
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ So Abram departed, as the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brotherʼs son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ then in the land.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ appeared unto Abram, and said, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ altar unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, who appeared unto him.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸩⸨/fix⸩chap⸼ 13⸼ ⸨fix:15⸼⸩11⸨/fix⸩⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 13⸼ 4⸼
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of ⸨fix:Beth‑el⸩Bethel⸨/fix⸩, and pitched his tent, ⸨i⸩having⸨/i⸩ ⸨fix:Beth‑el⸩Bethel⸨/fix⸩ on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and called upon the name of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And Abram journeyed, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩going on still toward the south.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩in going and journeying⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ grievous in the land.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ a fair woman to look upon:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Say, I pray thee, thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ very fair.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaohʼs house.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abramʼs wife.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ thy wife?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Why saidst thou, She ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take ⸨i⸩her⸨/i⸩, and go thy way.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And Pharaoh commanded ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.⸨marg⸩
