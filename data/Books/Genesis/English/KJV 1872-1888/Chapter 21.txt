₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ visited Sarah as he had said, and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ did unto Sarah ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ as he had spoken.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 17⸼ ⸨err:19⸼⸩19⸨/err⸩⸨row⸩& 18⸼ 10⸼
₂ For Sarah ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Acts 7⸼ 8⸼⸨row⸩Gal⸼ 4⸼ 22⸼⸨row⸩⸨err:Hebr⸼⸩Heb⸼⸨/err⸩ 11⸼ 11⸼
₃ And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
₄ And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ as God had commanded him.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 17⸼ 12⸼
₅ And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
₆ ¶ And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, ⸨i⸩so that⸨/i⸩ all that hear will laugh with me.
₇ And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ a son in his old age.
₈ And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the ⸨i⸩same⸨/i⸩ day that Isaac was weaned.
₉ ¶ And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
₁₀ Wherefore she said unto Abraham, ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ with Isaac.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ Gal⸼ 4⸼ ⸨err:30⸼⸩10⸼⸨/err⸩
₁₁ And the thing was very grievous in Abrahamʼs sight because of his son.
₁₂ ¶ And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
₁₃ And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy seed.
₁₄ And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ unto Hagar, putting ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer‑sheba.
₁₅ And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
₁₆ And she went, and sat her down over against ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩, and lift up her voice, and wept.
₁₇ And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩.
₁₈ Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
₁₉ And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
₂₀ And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
₂₁ And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
₂₂ ¶ And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with thee in all that thou doest:
₂₃ Now therefore swear unto me here by God ⁺that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my sonʼs son: ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩if thou shalt lie unto me⸨/i⸩.
₂₄ And Abraham said, I will swear.
₂₅ And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelechʼs servants had violently taken away.
₂₆ And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I ⸨i⸩of it⸨/i⸩, but to day.
₂₇ And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
₂₈ And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
₂₉ And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What ⸨i⸩mean⸨/i⸩ these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
₃₀ And he said, For ⸨i⸩these⸨/i⸩ seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
₃₁ Wherefore he called that place ˈBeer‑sheba; because there they sware both of them.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩ˈ That is, ⸨i⸩The well of the oath⸨/i⸩.
₃₂ Thus they made a covenant at Beer‑sheba; then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
₃₃ ¶ And ⸨i⸩Abraham⸨/i⸩ planted a ˈgrove in Beer‑sheba, and called there on the name of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, the everlasting God.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩tree⸨/i⸩.
₃₄ And Abraham sojourned in the Philistinesʼ land many days.
