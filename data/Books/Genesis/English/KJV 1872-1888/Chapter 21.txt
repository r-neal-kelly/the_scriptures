⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ For Sarah ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Acts 7⸼ 8⸼⸨row⸩Gal⸼ 4⸼ 22⸼⸨row⸩⸨fix:Hebr⸼⸩Heb⸼⸨/fix⸩ 11⸼ 11⸼
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ as God had commanded him.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 17⸼ 12⸼
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, ⸨i⸩so that⸨/i⸩ all that hear will laugh with me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ a son in his old age.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the ⸨i⸩same⸨/i⸩ day that Isaac was weaned.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ Wherefore she said unto Abraham, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ with Isaac.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Gal⸼ 4⸼ ⸨fix:30⸼⸩10⸼⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And the thing was very grievous in Abrahamʼs sight because of his son.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy seed.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ unto Hagar, putting ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer‑sheba.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And she went, and sat her down over against ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩ a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩, and lift up her voice, and wept.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with thee in all that thou doest:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore swear unto me here by God ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my sonʼs son: ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩if thou shalt lie unto me⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And Abraham said, I will swear.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelechʼs servants had violently taken away.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I ⸨i⸩of it⸨/i⸩, but to day.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What ⸨i⸩mean⸨/i⸩ these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ And he said, For ⸨i⸩these⸨/i⸩ seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ Wherefore he called that place ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Beer‑sheba; because there they sware both of them.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That is, ⸨i⸩The well of the oath⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ Thus they made a covenant at Beer‑sheba; then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨i⸩Abraham⸨/i⸩ planted a ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩grove in Beer‑sheba, and called there on the name of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, the everlasting God.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩tree⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩34⸨/sub⸩ And Abraham sojourned in the Philistinesʼ land many days.⸨marg⸩
