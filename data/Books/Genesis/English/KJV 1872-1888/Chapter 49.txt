⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ Dan shall be a serpent by the way, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩an arrow‑snake⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot ⸨i⸩at him⸨/i⸩, and hated him:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty ⸨i⸩God⸨/i⸩ of Jacob; (from thence ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩Even⸨/i⸩ by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.⸨marg⸩
