₃ ¶ Reuben, thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:⸨marg⸩
₄ Unstable as water, ⁺thou shalt not excel; because thou ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ wentest up to thy fatherʼs bed; then defiledst thou ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨err:: ˈ⸩⸨i⸩: ˈ⸨/i⸩⸨/err⸩he went up to my couch.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩do not ⸨err:thou⸩tho·⸨/err⸩ excel⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ ⸨err:35⸼⸩35⸨/err⸩ 22⸼⸨row⸩1 Chron⸼ ⸨err:5⸼⸩5⸨/err⸩ 1⸼⸨row⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩my couch is gone⸨/i⸩.

₇ Cursed ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ their anger, for ⸨i⸩it was⸨/i⸩ fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.⸨marg⸩
₈ ¶ Judah, thou ⸨i⸩art he⸨/i⸩ whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ in the neck of thine enemies; thy fatherʼs children shall bow down before thee.⸨marg⸩
₉ Judah ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a lionʼs whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?⸨marg⸩
₁₀ The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him ⸨i⸩shall⸨/i⸩ the gathering of the people ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
₁₁ Binding his foal unto the vine, and his assʼs colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:⸨marg⸩
₁₂ His eyes ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.⸨marg⸩
₁₃ ¶ Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ for an haven of ships; and his border ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ unto Zidon.⸨marg⸩
₁₄ ¶ Issachar ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a strong ass couching down between two burdens:⸨marg⸩
₁₅ And he saw that rest ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ good, and the land that ⸨i⸩it was⸨/i⸩ pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ ¶ Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.⸨marg⸩

₂₅ ⸨i⸩Even⸨/i⸩ by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:⸨marg⸩
₂₆ The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.⸨marg⸩
₂₇ ¶ Benjamin shall ravin ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.⸨marg⸩
₂₈ ¶ All these ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the twelve tribes of Israel: and this ⸨i⸩is it⸨/i⸩ that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.⸨marg⸩
₂₉ And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ bury me with my fathers in the cave that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the field of Ephron the Hittite,⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 47⸼ 30⸼
