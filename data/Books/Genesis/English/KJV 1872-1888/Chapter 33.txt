⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ those ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩to thee?⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And he said, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩What ⸨i⸩meanest⸨/i⸩ thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, ⸨i⸩These are⸨/i⸩ to find grace in the sight of my lord.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩What is all this band to thee?⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩keep that thou hast unto thyself.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩eb⸼⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:be ⸩⸨/fix⸩that to ⸨fix:thee⸩··⸨/fix⸩ that⸨fix:⸨/i⸩ is ⸨i⸩⸩ ⸨/fix⸩thine⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ tender, and the flocks and herds with young ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩according to the foot of the work, &c⸼ and according to the foot of the children⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Succoth.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That is, ⸨i⸩booths⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Shechem, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan‑aram; and pitched his tent before the city.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Called, Acts 7⸼ ⸨fix:16⸼⸩16⸨/fix⸩, ⸨i⸩Sychem⸨/i⸩.
