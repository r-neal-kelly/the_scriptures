⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ If thou doest well, shalt thou not ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.

⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And now ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brotherʼs blood from thy hand;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And Cain said unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩My punishment ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ greater than I can bear.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩My iniquity⸨/i⸩ is ⸨i⸩greater than that it may be forgiven⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ every one that findeth me shall slay me.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Cain went out from the presence of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Chanoch⸨/i⸩.
