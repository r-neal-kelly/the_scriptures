⸨cen⸩CHAPTER IV⸼
⸨i⸩₁ The birth, trade, and religion of Cain and Abel. ₈ The murder of Abel. ₁₁ The curse of Cain. ₁₇ Enoch the first city. ₁₉ Lamech and his two wives. ₂₅ The birth of Seth, ₂₆ and Enos.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
₂ And she again bare his brother ⁺Abel. And Abel was ⁺a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
₃ And ⁺in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
₄ And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his ⁺flock and of the fat thereof. And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ respect unto Abel and to his offering:
₅ But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
₆ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
₇ If thou doest well, shalt thou not ˈbe accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And ˈunto thee ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
₈ And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
₉ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Cain, Where ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: ⸨i⸩Am⸨/i⸩ I my brotherʼs keeper?
₁₀ And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brotherʼs ⁺blood crieth unto me from the ground.
₁₁ And now ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brotherʼs blood from thy hand;
₁₂ When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
₁₃ And Cain said unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, ˈMy punishment ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ greater than I can bear.
₁₄ Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ every one that findeth me shall slay me.
₁₅ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
₁₆ ¶ And Cain went out from the presence of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
₁₇ And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare ⁺Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
₁₈ And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat ⁺Lamech.
₁₉ ¶ And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
₂₀ And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and ⸨i⸩of such as have⸨/i⸩ cattle.
₂₁ And his brotherʼs name ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
₂₂ And Zillah, she also bare Tubal‑cain, an ⁺instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal‑cain ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Naamah.
₂₃ And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for ˈI have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man ˈto my hurt.
₂₄ If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
₂₅ ¶ And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name ⁺Seth: For God, ⸨i⸩said she⸨/i⸩, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
₂₆ And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name ⁺Enos: then began men ˈto call upon the name of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
