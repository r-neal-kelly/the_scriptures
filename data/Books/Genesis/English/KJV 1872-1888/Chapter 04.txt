₄ And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his ⁺flock and of the fat thereof. And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ respect unto Abel and to his offering:⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ ⸨err:Hebr⸼⸩Heb⸼⸨/err⸩ ⸨err:11⸼⸩11⸨/err⸩ 4⸼⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩sheep⸨/i⸩, or ⸨i⸩goats⸨/i⸩.
₅ But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.⸨marg⸩
₆ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?⸨marg⸩
₇ If thou doest well, shalt thou not ˈbe accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And ˈunto thee ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩have the excellency?⸨/i⸩⸨row⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩subject unto thee⸨/i⸩.

₉ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Cain, Where ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: ⸨i⸩Am⸨/i⸩ I my brotherʼs keeper?⸨marg⸩
₁₀ And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brotherʼs ⁺blood crieth unto me from the ground.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩bloods⸨/i⸩.
₁₁ And now ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brotherʼs blood from thy hand;⸨marg⸩
₁₂ When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.⸨marg⸩
₁₃ And Cain said unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, ˈMy punishment ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ greater than I can bear.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩My iniquity⸨/i⸩ is ⸨i⸩greater than that it may be forgiven⸨/i⸩.
₁₄ Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ every one that findeth me shall slay me.⸨marg⸩
₁₅ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ ¶ And Cain went out from the presence of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare ⁺Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Chanoch⸨/i⸩.

₂₀ And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and ⸨i⸩of such as have⸨/i⸩ cattle.⸨marg⸩
