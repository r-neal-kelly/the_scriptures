⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Arise, go to Padan‑aram, to the house of Bethuel thy motherʼs father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy motherʼs brother.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Hos⸼ 12⸼ 12⸼
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩a multitude of people;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩an assembly of people⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put ⸨i⸩them for⸨/i⸩ his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ And, behold, the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ stood above it, and said, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 35⸼ 1⸼⸨row⸩& 48⸼ 3⸼

⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And, behold, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ with thee, and will keep thee in all ⸨i⸩places⸨/i⸩ whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ which I have spoken to thee of.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ is in this place; and I knew ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ not.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this place! this ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ none other but the house of God, and this ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the gate of heaven.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ his pillows, and set it up ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And he called the name of that place ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Beth‑el: but the name of that city ⸨i⸩was called⸨/i⸩ Luz at the first.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That is, ⸨i⸩the house of God⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ So that I come again to my fatherʼs house in peace; then shall the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ be my God:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And this stone, which I have set ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ a pillar, shall be Godʼs house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.⸨marg⸩
