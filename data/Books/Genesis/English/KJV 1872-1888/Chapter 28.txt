₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.⸨marg⸩
₂ ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Arise, go to Padan‑aram, to the house of Bethuel thy motherʼs father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy motherʼs brother.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Hos⸼ 12⸼ 12⸼
₃ And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be ⁺a multitude of people;⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩an assembly of people⸨/i⸩.
₄ And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land ⁺wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩of thy sojournings⸨/i⸩.
₅ And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan‑aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacobʼs and Esauʼs mother.⸨marg⸩
₆ ¶ When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan‑aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;⸨marg⸩

₈ And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan ⁺pleased not Isaac his father;⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩were evil in the eyes, &c⸼⸨/i⸩
₉ Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abrahamʼs son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.⸨marg⸩
₁₀ ¶ And Jacob went out from Beer‑sheba, and went toward ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Haran.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Called, Acts 7⸼ ⸨fix:2⸼⸩2⸨/fix⸩, ⸨i⸩Charran⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
₁₁ And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put ⸨i⸩them for⸨/i⸩ his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.⸨marg⸩
₁₂ And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.⸨marg⸩
₁₃ ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ And, behold, the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ stood above it, and said, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 35⸼ 1⸼⸨row⸩& 48⸼ 3⸼

₁₅ And, behold, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ with thee, and will keep thee in all ⸨i⸩places⸨/i⸩ whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ which I have spoken to thee of.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ ¶ And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ is in this place; and I knew ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ not.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this place! this ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ none other but the house of God, and this ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the gate of heaven.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ his pillows, and set it up ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.⸨marg⸩
₁₉ And he called the name of that place ˈBeth‑el: but the name of that city ⸨i⸩was called⸨/i⸩ Luz at the first.⸨marg⸩ˈ That is, ⸨i⸩the house of God⸨/i⸩.
₂₀ And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,⸨marg⸩
₂₁ So that I come again to my fatherʼs house in peace; then shall the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ be my God:⸨marg⸩
₂₂ And this stone, which I have set ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ a pillar, shall be Godʼs house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.⸨marg⸩
