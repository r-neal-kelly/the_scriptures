⸨size:0.85⸩⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ Abraham sojourneth at Gerar, ⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ denieth his wife, and loseth her. ⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ Abimelech is reproved for her in a dream. ⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ He rebuketh Abraham, ⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ restoreth Sarah, ⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ and reproveth her. ⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ He is healed by Abrahamʼs prayer.⸨/i⸩⸨/size⸩

⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou ⸨i⸩art but⸨/i⸩ a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩a manʼs wife.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩married to an husband⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ Said he not unto me, She ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ my sister? and she, even she herself said, He ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ my brother: in the ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩simplicity⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩sincerity⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore restore the man ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ wife; for he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore ⸨i⸩her⸨/i⸩ not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ thine.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not in this place; and they will slay me for my wifeʼs sake.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And yet indeed ⸨i⸩she is⸨/i⸩ my sister; she ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my fatherʼs house, that I said unto her, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ say of me, He ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ my brother.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 12⸼ 13⸼
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And Abimelech said, Behold, my land ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ before thee: dwell ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩where it pleaseth thee.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩as⸨/i⸩ is ⸨i⸩good in thine eyes⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand ⸨i⸩pieces⸨/i⸩ of silver: behold, he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ with thee, and with all ⸨i⸩other⸨/i⸩: thus she was reproved.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ ¶ So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare ⸨i⸩children⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ For the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abrahamʼs wife.⸨marg⸩
