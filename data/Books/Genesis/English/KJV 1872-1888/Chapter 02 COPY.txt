⸨cen⸩CHAPTER II⸼
⸨i⸩₁ The first sabbath. ₄ The manner of the creation. ₈ The planting of the garden of Eden, ₁₀ and the river thereof. ₁₇ The tree of knowledge only forbidden. ₁₉, ₂₀ The naming of the creatures. ₂₁ The making of woman, and institution of marriage.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩Thus⸨/sc⸩ the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
₂ ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
₃ And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God ⁺created and made.
₄ ¶ These ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God made the earth and the heavens,
₅ And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ not a man to till the ground.
₆ But ˈthere went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
₇ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God formed man ⁺⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ the ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ man became a living soul.
₈ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
₉ And out of the ground made the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
₁₀ And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
₁₁ The name of the first ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ Pison: that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ gold;
₁₂ And the gold of that land ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ good: there ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ bdellium and the onyx stone.
₁₃ And the name of the second river ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Gihon: the same ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ it that compasseth the whole land of ⁺Ethiopia.
₁₄ And the name of the third river ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Hiddekel: that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ it which goeth ˈtoward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Euphrates.
₁₅ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God took ˈthe man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
₁₆ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden ⁺thou mayest freely eat:
₁₇ But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof ⁺thou shalt surely die.
₁₈ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God said, ⸨i⸩It is⸨/i⸩ not good that the man should be alone; I will make ⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ him an help ⁺meet for him.
₁₉ And out of the ground the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ unto ˈAdam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the name thereof.
₂₀ And Adam ⁺gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
₂₁ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
₂₂ And the rib, which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God had taken from man, ⁺made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
₂₃ And Adam said, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was ⸨i⸩ᶠ⸨/i⸩ taken out of man.
₂₄ ⸨i⸩ᵍ⸨/i⸩ Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
₂₅ And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
