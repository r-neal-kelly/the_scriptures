⸨cen⸩CHAPTER XV⸼
⸨i⸩₁ God encourageth Abram. ₂ Abram complaineth for want of an heir. ₄ God promiseth him a son, and a multiplying of his seed. ₆ Abram is justified by faith. ₇ Canaan is promised again, and confirmed by a sign, ₁₂ and a vision.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩After⸨/sc⸩ these things the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ thy shield, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ thy exceeding ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ great reward.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ ⸨err:Psal⸼⸩Ps⸼⸨/err⸩ 16⸼ 5⸼
₂ And Abram said, Lord ⸨sc⸩God⸨/sc⸩, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this Eliezer of Damascus?⸨marg⸩
₃ And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.⸨marg⸩
₄ And, behold, the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩came⸨/i⸩ unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.⸨marg⸩
₅ And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ So shall thy seed be.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Rom⸼ 4⸼ 18⸼

₇ And he said unto him, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.⸨marg⸩
₈ And he said, Lord ⸨sc⸩God⸨/sc⸩, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?⸨marg⸩
₉ And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.⸨marg⸩
₁₀ And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.⸨marg⸩
₁₁ And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.⸨marg⸩
₁₂ And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.⸨marg⸩
₁₃ And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land ⸨i⸩that is⸨/i⸩ not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ Acts 7⸼ 6⸼
₁₄ And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.⸨marg⸩
₁₅ And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not yet full.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and ⁺a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a lamp of fire⸨/i⸩.
₁₈ In the same day the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ made a covenant with Abram, saying, ⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 12⸼ 7⸼⸨row⸩& 13⸼ 15⸼⸨row⸩& 26⸼ 4⸼⸨row⸩Deut⸼ 34⸼ 4⸼
