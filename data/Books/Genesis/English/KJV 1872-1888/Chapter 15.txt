⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sc⸩After⸨/sc⸩ these things the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ thy shield, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ thy exceeding ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ great reward.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Psal⸼⸩Ps⸼⸨/fix⸩ 16⸼ 5⸼
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And Abram said, Lord ⸨sc⸩God⸨/sc⸩, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this Eliezer of Damascus?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And, behold, the word of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩came⸨/i⸩ unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ So shall thy seed be.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Rom⸼ 4⸼ 18⸼

⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto him, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Lord ⸨sc⸩God⸨/sc⸩, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land ⸨i⸩that is⸨/i⸩ not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Acts 7⸼ 6⸼
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not yet full.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a lamp of fire⸨/i⸩.
