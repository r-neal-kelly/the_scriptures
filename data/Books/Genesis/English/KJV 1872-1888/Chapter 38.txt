⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Hirah.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chron⸼ 2⸼ 3⸼

⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brotherʼs wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brotherʼs wife, that he spilled ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.⸨marg⸩

⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy fatherʼs house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren ⸨i⸩did⸨/i⸩. And Tamar went and dwelt in her fatherʼs house.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judahʼs wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩the days were multiplied⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And she put her widowʼs garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩an open place, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩the door of eyes⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩of Enajim⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ When Judah saw her, he thought her ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ an harlot; because she had covered her face.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And he said, I will send ⸨i⸩thee⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give ⸨i⸩me⸨/i⸩ a pledge, till thou send ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨fix:?⸩⸨i⸩?⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩a kid of the goats⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ pledge from the womanʼs hand: but he found her not.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the harlot, that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this ⸨i⸩place⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩in ⸨fix:Enajim⸩E·ajim⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.

⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And Judah said, Let her take ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ to her, lest we ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩become a ⸨fix:contempt⸩·ontempt⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ When she ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩, ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ And Judah acknowledged ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ in her womb.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, when she travailed, that ⸨i⸩the one⸨/i⸩ put out ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩How hast thou broken forth? ⸨i⸩this⸨/i⸩ breach ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ upon thee: therefore his name was called⸨fix: ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩⸩ ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨/fix⸩Pharez.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩Wherefore hast thou made⸨/i⸩ this ⸨i⸩breach against thee?⸨/i⸩⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ 1 Chron⸼ 2⸼ 4⸼⸨row⸩Matt⸼ 1⸼ 3⸼⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That is, ⸨i⸩a breach⸨/i⸩.
