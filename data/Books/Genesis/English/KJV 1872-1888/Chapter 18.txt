⸨i⸩₁ Abraham entertaineth three angels. ₉ Sarah is reproved for laughing at the strange promise. ₁₇ The destruction of Sodom is revealed to Abraham. ₂₃ Abraham maketh intercession for the men thereof.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ the ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ ⸨err:Hebr⸼⸩Heb⸼⸨/err⸩ ⸨err:13⸼⸩13⸨/err⸩ 2⸼
₂ And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,⸨marg⸩
₃ And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:⸨marg⸩
₄ Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:⸨marg⸩
₅ And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and ⁺comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore ⁺are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩stay⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩you have passed⸨/i⸩⸨err:.⸩⸨/err⸩
₆ And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, ⁺Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, and make cakes upon the hearth.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Hasten⸨/i⸩.
₇ And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.⸨marg⸩
₈ And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.⸨marg⸩
₉ ¶ And they said unto him, Where ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.⸨marg⸩
₁₀ And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ in the tent door, which ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ behind him.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 17⸼ 19⸼⸨row⸩& 21⸼ 2⸼
₁₁ Now Abraham and Sarah ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ old ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ well stricken in age; ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.⸨marg⸩
₁₂ Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ lord being old also?⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ 1 Pet⸼ 3⸼ 6⸼
₁₃ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?⸨marg⸩
₁₄ Is any thing too hard for the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.⸨marg⸩
₁₅ Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ ¶ And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;⸨marg⸩
₁₈ Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ blessed in him?⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 12⸼ 3⸼⸨row⸩& 22⸼ 18⸼⸨row⸩Acts 3⸼ 25⸼⸨row⸩Gal⸼ 3⸼ 8⸼
₁₉ For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, to do justice and judgment; that the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.⸨marg⸩
₂₀ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;⸨marg⸩
₂₁ I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.⸨marg⸩
₂₂ And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
₂₃ ¶ And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?⸨marg⸩
₂₄ Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ therein?⸨marg⸩
₂₅ That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?⸨marg⸩
₂₆ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.⸨marg⸩
₂₇ And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which ⸨i⸩am but⸨/i⸩ dust and ashes:⸨marg⸩
₂₈ Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for ⸨i⸩lack of⸨/i⸩ five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩.⸨marg⸩
₂₉ And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ for fortyʼs sake.⸨marg⸩
₃₀ And he said ⸨i⸩unto him⸨/i⸩, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, if I find thirty there.⸨marg⸩
₃₁ And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ for twentyʼs sake.⸨marg⸩
₃₂ And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ for tenʼs sake.⸨marg⸩
₃₃ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.⸨marg⸩
