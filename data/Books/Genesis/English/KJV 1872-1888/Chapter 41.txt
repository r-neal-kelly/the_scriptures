⸨i⸩₁ Pharaohʼs two dreams. ₂₅ Joseph interpreteth them. ₃₃ He giveth Pharaoh counsel. ₃₈ Joseph is advanced. ₅₀ He begetteth Manasseh and Ephraim. ₅₄ The famine beginneth.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.⸨marg⸩
₂ And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.⸨marg⸩
₃ And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the ⸨i⸩other⸨/i⸩ kine upon the brink of the river.⸨marg⸩
₄ And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.⸨marg⸩
₅ And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, ⁺rank and good.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩fat⸨/i⸩.
₆ And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.⸨marg⸩
₇ And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, ⸨i⸩it was⸨/i⸩ a dream.⸨marg⸩
₈ And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.⸨marg⸩
₉ ¶ Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:⸨marg⸩
₁₀ Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guardʼs house, ⸨i⸩both⸨/i⸩ me and the chief baker:⸨marg⸩
₁₁ And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.⸨marg⸩
₁₂ And ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 40⸼ 12, &c⸼
₁₃ And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.⸨marg⸩
₁₄ ¶ ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they ⁺brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved ⸨i⸩himself⸨/i⸩, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Psal⸼ 105⸼ 20⸼⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩made him run⸨/i⸩.
₁₅ And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ ˈthou canst understand a dream to interpret it.⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, when ⸨i⸩thou hearest a dream, thou canst interpret it⸨/i⸩.
₁₆ And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, ⸨i⸩It is⸨/i⸩ not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:⸨marg⸩
₁₈ And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:⸨marg⸩
₁₉ And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:⸨marg⸩
₂₀ And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:⸨marg⸩
₂₁ And when they had ⁺eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩come to the inward parts of them⸨/i⸩.
₂₂ And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:⸨marg⸩
₂₃ And, behold, seven ears, ˈwithered, thin, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩small⸨/i⸩.
₂₄ And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told ⸨i⸩this⸨/i⸩ unto the magicians; but ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ none that could declare ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ to me.⸨marg⸩
₂₅ ¶ And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ about to do.⸨marg⸩
₂₆ The seven good kine ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ seven years; and the seven good ears ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ seven years: the dream ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ one.⸨marg⸩
₂₇ And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.⸨marg⸩
₂₈ This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.⸨marg⸩
₂₉ Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:⸨marg⸩
₃₀ And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;⸨marg⸩
₃₁ And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ very ⁺grievous.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩heavy⸨/i⸩.
₃₂ And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ because the thing ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ ˈestablished by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩prepared of God⸨/i⸩.
₃₃ Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩
₃₄ Let Pharaoh do ⸨i⸩this⸨/i⸩, and let him appoint ˈofficers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩overseers⸨/i⸩.
₃₅ And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.⸨marg⸩
₃₆ And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land ⁺perish not through the famine.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩be not ⸨fix:cut⸩·ut⸨/fix⸩ off⸨/i⸩.
₃₇ ¶ And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.⸨marg⸩
₃₈ And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find ⸨i⸩such a one⸨/i⸩ as this ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩, a man in whom the Spirit of God ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩⸨fix:?⸩⸨i⸩?⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨marg⸩
₃₉ And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, ⸨i⸩there is⸨/i⸩ none so discreet and wise as thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩⸨fix::⸩⸨i⸩:⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨marg⸩
₄₀ ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ⁺ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Psal⸼ 105⸼ 21⸼⸨row⸩1 Mac⸼ 2⸼ 53⸼⸨row⸩Acts 7⸼ 10⸼⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩armed⸨/i⸩, or, ⸨i⸩kiss⸨/i⸩.
₄₁ And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩
₄₂ And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Josephʼs hand, and arrayed him in vestures of ˈfine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩silk⸨/i⸩.
₄₃ And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, ˈ⁺Bow the knee: and he made him ⸨i⸩ruler⸨/i⸩ over all the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩Tender father⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩Abrech⸨/i⸩.
₄₄ And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩
₄₅ And Pharaoh called Josephʼs name Zaphnath‑paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti‑pherah ˈpriest of On. And Joseph went out over ⸨i⸩all⸨/i⸩ the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩prince⸨/i⸩.
₄₆ ¶ And Joseph ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩
₄₇ And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.⸨marg⸩
₄₈ And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ round about every city, laid he up in the same.⸨marg⸩
₄₉ And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for ⸨i⸩it was⸨/i⸩ without number.⸨marg⸩
₅₀ ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti‑pherah ˈpriest of On bare unto him.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 46⸼ 20⸼⸨row⸩& 48⸼ 5⸼⸨row⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩prince⸨/i⸩.
₅₁ And Joseph called the name of the firstborn ˈManasseh: For God, ⸨i⸩said he⸨/i⸩, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my fatherʼs house.⸨marg⸩ˈ That is, ⸨i⸩Forgetting⸨/i⸩.
₅₂ And the name of the second called he ˈEphraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.⸨marg⸩ˈ That is, ⸨i⸩Fruitful⸨/i⸩.
₅₃ ¶ And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.⸨marg⸩
₅₄ ⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ Psal⸼ 105⸼ 16⸼
₅₅ And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.⸨marg⸩
₅₆ And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened ⁺all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩all wherein⸨/i⸩ was.
