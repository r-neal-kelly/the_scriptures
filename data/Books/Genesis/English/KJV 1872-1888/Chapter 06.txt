₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,⸨marg⸩
₂ That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.⸨marg⸩
₃ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.⸨marg⸩
₄ There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare ⸨i⸩children⸨/i⸩ to them, the same ⸨i⸩became⸨/i⸩ mighty men which ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ of old, men of renown.⸨marg⸩
₅ ¶ And ⸨sc⸩God⸨/sc⸩ saw that the wickedness of man ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ great in the earth, and ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ ˈevery imagination of the thoughts of his ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ heart ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ only evil ⁺continually.⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩the whole imagination⸨/i⸩.

₆ And it repented the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.⸨marg⸩
₇ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; ⁺both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩from man, unto beast⸨/i⸩.
₈ But Noah found grace in the eyes of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.⸨marg⸩
₉ ¶ These ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the generations of Noah: ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Noah was a just man ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ ˈperfect in his generations, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ Noah walked with God.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Ecclus⸼ 44⸼ 17⸼⸨row⸩2 Pet⸼ 2⸼ 5⸼⸨row⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩upright⸨/i⸩.
₁₀ And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.⸨marg⸩
₁₁ The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.⸨marg⸩
₁₂ And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.⸨marg⸩
₁₃ And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy ˈthem with the earth.⸨marg⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩from the earth⸨/i⸩.
₁₄ ¶ Make thee an ark of gopher wood; ⁺rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.⸨marg⸩⁺ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩nests⸨/i⸩.
₁₅ And this ⸨i⸩is the fashion⸨/i⸩ which thou shalt make it ⸨err:⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩: ⸩⸨i⸩of: ⸨/i⸩⸨/err⸩The length of the ark ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; ⸨i⸩with⸨/i⸩ lower, second, and third ⸨i⸩stories⸨/i⸩ shalt thou make it.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the breath of life, from under heaven; ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ every thing that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the earth shall die.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sonsʼ wives with thee.⸨marg⸩
₁₉ And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every ⸨i⸩sort⸨/i⸩ shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ alive with thee; they shall be male and female.⸨marg⸩
₂₀ Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every ⸨i⸩sort⸨/i⸩ shall come unto thee, to keep ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ alive.⸨marg⸩
₂₁ And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.⸨marg⸩
