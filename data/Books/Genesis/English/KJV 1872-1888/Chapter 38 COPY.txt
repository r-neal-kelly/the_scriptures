⸨cen⸩CHAPTER XXXVIII⸼
⸨i⸩₁ Judah begetteth Er, Onan, and Shelah. ₆ Er marrieth Tamar. ₈ The trespass of Onan. ₁₁ Tamar stayeth for Shelah. ₁₃ She deceiveth Judah. ₂₇ She beareth twins, Pharez and Zarah.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Hirah.
₂ And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.
₃ And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
₄ ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
₅ And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
₆ And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Tamar.
₇ And ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Er, Judahʼs firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ slew him.
₈ And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brotherʼs wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
₉ And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brotherʼs wife, that he spilled ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
₁₀ And the thing which he did ⁺displeased the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩: wherefore he slew him also.
₁₁ Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy fatherʼs house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren ⸨i⸩did⸨/i⸩. And Tamar went and dwelt in her fatherʼs house.
₁₂ ¶ And ⁺in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judahʼs wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
₁₃ And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
₁₄ And she put her widowʼs garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in ⁺an open place, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.
₁₅ When Judah saw her, he thought her ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ an harlot; because she had covered her face.
₁₆ And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
₁₇ And he said, I will send ⸨i⸩thee⸨/i⸩ ⁺a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give ⸨i⸩me⸨/i⸩ a pledge, till thou send ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨err:?⸩⸨i⸩?⸨/i⸩⸨/err⸩
₁₈ And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in thine hand. And he gave ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
₁₉ And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
₂₀ And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ pledge from the womanʼs hand: but he found her not.
₂₁ Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the harlot, that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ˈopenly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this ⸨i⸩place⸨/i⸩.
₂₂ And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ there was no harlot in this ⸨i⸩place⸨/i⸩.
₂₃ And Judah said, Let her take ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ to her, lest we ⁺be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
₂₄ ¶ And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
₂₅ When she ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩, ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
₂₆ And Judah acknowledged ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
₂₇ ¶ And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ in her womb.
₂₈ And it came to pass, when she travailed, that ⸨i⸩the one⸨/i⸩ put out ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
₂₉ And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, ˈHow hast thou broken forth? ⸨i⸩this⸨/i⸩ breach ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ upon thee: therefore his name was called⸨err: ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ ˈ⸩ ˈ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ ⸨/err⸩Pharez.
₃₀ And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.
