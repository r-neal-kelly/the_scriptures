⸨add⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨/add⸩⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ he commanded ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩the steward of his house, saying, Fill the menʼs sacks ⸨i⸩with⸨/i⸩ food, as much as they can carry, and put every manʼs money in his sackʼs mouth.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ him ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ was ⸨i⸩over his house⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sackʼs mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩And⸨/i⸩ when they were gone out of the city, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ not ⸨i⸩yet⸨/i⸩ far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ not this ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or⸨fix:, ⸩ ⸨/fix⸩⸨i⸩maketh trial?⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ Behold, the money, which we found in our sacksʼ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lordʼs house silver or gold?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lordʼs bondmen.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And he said, Now also ⸨i⸩let⸨/i⸩ it ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And he searched, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjaminʼs sack.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Judah and his brethren came to Josephʼs house; for he ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ And Joseph said unto them, What deed ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩divine?⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩make trial?⸨/i⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ my lordʼs servants, both we, and ⸨i⸩he⸨/i⸩ also with whom the cup is found.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And he said, God forbid that I should do so: ⸨i⸩but⸨/i⸩ the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ ¶ Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lordʼs ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ even as Pharaoh.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for ⸨i⸩if⸨/i⸩ he should leave his father, ⸨i⸩his father⸨/i⸩ would die.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩23⸨/sub⸩ And thou saidst unto thy servants, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.⸨marg⸩⸨fix:⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨fix:chap⸼⸩·p⸼⸨/fix⸩ 43⸼⸨fix: 3⸼⸩⸨/fix⸩
⸨sub⸩24⸨/sub⸩ And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩25⸨/sub⸩ And our father said, Go again, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ buy us a little food.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩26⸨/sub⸩ And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the manʼs face, except our youngest brother ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ with us.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩27⸨/sub⸩ And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two ⸨i⸩sons⸨/i⸩⸨fix::⸩⸨i⸩:⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩28⸨/sub⸩ And the one went out from me, and I said, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 37⸼ 33⸼
⸨sub⸩29⸨/sub⸩ And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩30⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the ladʼs life;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩31⸨/sub⸩ It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not ⸨i⸩with us⸨/i⸩, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩32⸨/sub⸩ For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 43⸼ 9⸼
⸨sub⸩33⸨/sub⸩ Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩34⸨/sub⸩ For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩come on my father.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩find my father⸨/i⸩.
