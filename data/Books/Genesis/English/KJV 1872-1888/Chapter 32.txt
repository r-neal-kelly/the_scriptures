⸨i⸩₁ Jacobʼs vision at Mahanaim. ₃ His message to Esau. ₆ He is afraid of Esauʼs coming. ₉ He prayeth for deliverance. ₁₃ He sendeth a present to Esau. ₂₄ He wrestleth with an angel at Peniel, where he is called Israel. ₃₁ He halteth.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.⸨marg⸩
₂ And when Jacob saw them, he said, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Godʼs host: and he called the name of that place ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Mahanaim.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That ⸨fix:is⸩⸨/fix⸩⸨fix:, ⸩ ⸨/fix⸩⸨i⸩two ⸨fix:hosts⸩···⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨fix:, ⸩ ⸨/fix⸩or, ⸨i⸩⸨fix:camps⸩ca·⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
₃ And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩country of Edom.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩field⸨/i⸩.
₄ And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:⸨marg⸩
₅ And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.⸨marg⸩
₆ ¶ And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.⸨marg⸩
₇ Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;⸨marg⸩
₈ And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.⸨marg⸩
₉ ¶ And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ which saidst unto me, ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 31⸼ 13⸼
₁₀ ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩I am less than all, &c⸼⸨/i⸩
₁₁ Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ the mother ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩with the children.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩upon⸨/i⸩.
₁₂ And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.⸨marg⸩
₁₃ ¶ And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;⸨marg⸩
₁₄ Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,⸨marg⸩
₁₅ Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ And he delivered ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.⸨marg⸩
₁₇ And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou? and whither goest thou? and whose ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ these before thee?⸨marg⸩
₁₈ Then thou shalt say, ⸨i⸩They be⸨/i⸩ thy servant Jacobʼs; it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ behind us.⸨marg⸩
₁₉ And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.⸨marg⸩
₂₀ And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩of me.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩my face⸨/i⸩⸨fix:.⸩⸨/fix⸩
₂₁ So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.⸨marg⸩
₂₂ And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.⸨marg⸩
₂₃ And he took them, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩caused ⸨fix:to⸩·⸨/fix⸩ pass⸨/i⸩.
₂₄ ¶ And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩breaking of the day.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩ascending of the morning⸨/i⸩.
₂₅ And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacobʼs thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.⸨marg⸩
₂₆ And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ Hos⸼ 12⸼ 4⸼
₂₇ And he said unto him, What ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy name? And he said, Jacob.⸨marg⸩
₂₈ And he said, ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.⸨marg⸩⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ chap⸼ 35⸼ 10⸼
₂₉ And Jacob asked ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩, and said, Tell ⸨i⸩me⸨/i⸩, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ it ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.⸨marg⸩
₃₀ And Jacob called the name of the place ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ That is, ⸨i⸩the face of God⸨/i⸩.
₃₁ And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.⸨marg⸩
₃₂ Therefore the children of Israel eat not ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ the sinew which shrank, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacobʼs thigh in the sinew that shrank.⸨marg⸩
