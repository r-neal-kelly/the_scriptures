⸨cen⸩CHAPTER XXXII⸼
⸨i⸩₁ Jacobʼs vision at Mahanaim. ₃ His message to Esau. ₆ He is afraid of Esauʼs coming. ₉ He prayeth for deliverance. ₁₃ He sendeth a present to Esau. ₂₄ He wrestleth with an angel at Peniel, where he is called Israel. ₃₁ He halteth.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
₂ And when Jacob saw them, he said, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Godʼs host: and he called the name of that place ˈMahanaim.
₃ And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the ⁺country of Edom.
₄ And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
₅ And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
₆ ¶ And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
₇ Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
₈ And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
₉ ¶ And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ which saidst unto me, ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
₁₀ ⁺I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
₁₁ Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ the mother ⁺with the children.
₁₂ And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
₁₃ ¶ And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
₁₄ Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
₁₅ Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
₁₆ And he delivered ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
₁₇ And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou? and whither goest thou? and whose ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ these before thee?
₁₈ Then thou shalt say, ⸨i⸩They be⸨/i⸩ thy servant Jacobʼs; it ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ behind us.
₁₉ And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
₂₀ And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept ⁺of me.
₂₁ So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
₂₂ And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
₂₃ And he took them, and ⁺sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
₂₄ ¶ And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the ⁺breaking of the day.
₂₅ And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacobʼs thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
₂₆ And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
₂₇ And he said unto him, What ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ thy name? And he said, Jacob.
₂₈ And he said, ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
₂₉ And Jacob asked ⸨i⸩him⸨/i⸩, and said, Tell ⸨i⸩me⸨/i⸩, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ it ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
₃₀ And Jacob called the name of the place ˈPeniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
₃₁ And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
₃₂ Therefore the children of Israel eat not ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ the sinew which shrank, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacobʼs thigh in the sinew that shrank.
