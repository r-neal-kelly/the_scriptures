⸨cen⸩CHAPTER XLVIII⸼
⸨i⸩₁ Joseph with his sons visiteth his sick father. ₂ Jacob strengtheneth himself to bless them. ₃ He repeateth the promise. ₅ He taketh Ephraim and Manasseh as his own. ₇ He telleth Joseph of his motherʼs grave. ₉ He blesseth Ephraim and Manasseh. ₁₇ He preferreth the younger before the elder. ₂₁ He prophesieth their return to Canaan.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ it came to pass after these things, that ⸨i⸩one⸨/i⸩ told Joseph, Behold, thy father ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
₂ And ⸨i⸩one⸨/i⸩ told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
₃ And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
₄ And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ an everlasting possession.
₅ ¶ And now thy ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
₆ And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
₇ And as for me, when I came from Padan, ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Beth‑lehem.
₈ And Israel beheld Josephʼs sons, and said, Who ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ these?
₉ And Joseph said unto his father, They ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ my sons, whom God hath given me in this ⸨i⸩place⸨/i⸩. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
₁₀ Now the eyes of Israel were ⁺dim for age, ⸨i⸩so that⸨/i⸩ he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
₁₁ And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.
₁₂ And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
₁₃ And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israelʼs left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israelʼs right hand, and brought ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ near unto him.
₁₄ And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ upon Ephraimʼs head, who ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the younger, and his left hand upon Manassehʼs head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the firstborn.
₁₅ ¶ And ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
₁₆ The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them ⁺grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
₁₇ And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his fatherʼs hand, to remove it from Ephraimʼs head unto Manassehʼs head.
₁₈ And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
₁₉ And his father refused, and said, I know ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, my son, I know ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨err:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/err⸩he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a ⁺multitude of nations.
₂₀ And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
₂₁ And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
₂₂ Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
