⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ it came to pass after these things, that ⸨i⸩one⸨/i⸩ told Joseph, Behold, thy father ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ And ⸨i⸩one⸨/i⸩ told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 28⸼ 13⸼⸨row⸩& 35⸼ 6⸼
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ an everlasting possession.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And now thy ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩b⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 41⸼ 50⸼⸨row⸩Josh⸼ 13⸼ 7⸼
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And as for me, when I came from Padan, ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet ⸨i⸩there was⸨/i⸩ but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ Beth‑lehem.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩c⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 35⸼ 19⸼
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ And Israel beheld Josephʼs sons, and said, Who ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ these?⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ And Joseph said unto his father, They ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ my sons, whom God hath given me in this ⸨i⸩place⸨/i⸩. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ Now the eyes of Israel were ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩dim for age, ⸨i⸩so that⸨/i⸩ he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩heavy⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israelʼs left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israelʼs right hand, and brought ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩ near unto him.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ upon Ephraimʼs head, who ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the younger, and his left hand upon Manassehʼs head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the firstborn.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩d⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Hebr⸼⸩Heb⸼⸨/fix⸩ 11⸼ 21⸼
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩⸨fix:as⸩·s⸨/fix⸩ fishes ⸨fix:do⸩··⸨/fix⸩ ⸨fix:increase⸩in··ease⸨/fix⸩⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his fatherʼs hand, to remove it from Ephraimʼs head unto Manassehʼs head.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ And his father refused, and said, I know ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩, my son, I know ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩⸨fix:: ⸩⸨i⸩: ⸨/i⸩⸨/fix⸩he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩multitude of nations.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩fulness⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩22⸨/sub⸩ Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.⸨marg⸩
