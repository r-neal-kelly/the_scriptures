₂ And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth ⸨i⸩upon⸨/i⸩ the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.⸨marg⸩

₉ And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;⸨marg⸩
₁₀ And with every living creature that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.⸨marg⸩

₁₂ And God said, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with you, for perpetual generations:⸨marg⸩
₁₃ I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.⸨marg⸩

₁₅ And I will remember my covenant, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.⸨marg⸩
₁₆ And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ upon the earth.⸨marg⸩

₂₀ And Noah began ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:⸨marg⸩
₂₁ And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.⸨marg⸩
₂₂ And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.⸨marg⸩
₂₃ And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ backward, and they saw not their fatherʼs nakedness.⸨marg⸩
₂₄ And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.⸨marg⸩
₂₅ And he said, Cursed ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.⸨marg⸩
₂₆ And he said, Blessed ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Shem; and Canaan shall be ⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩his servant.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩❙⸨/sup⸩ Or, ⸨i⸩servant to them⸨/i⸩.
