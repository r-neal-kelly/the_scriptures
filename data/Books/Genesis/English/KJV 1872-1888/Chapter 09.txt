₂ And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth ⸨i⸩upon⸨/i⸩ the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.

₅ And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every manʼs brother will I require the life of man.

₇ And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
₈ ¶ And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
₉ And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
₁₀ And with every living creature that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
₁₁ And ⸨i⸩ᶠ⸨/i⸩ I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᶠ⸨/i⸩ Isai⸼ 54⸼ 9⸼
₁₂ And God said, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with you, for perpetual generations:
₁₃ I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
₁₄ ⸨i⸩ᵍ⸨/i⸩ And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⸨i⸩ᵍ⸨/i⸩ Ecclus⸼ 43⸼ 11, 12⸼
₁₅ And I will remember my covenant, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
₁₆ And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ upon the earth.
₁₇ And God said unto Noah, This ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ upon the earth.
₁₈ ¶ And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the father of ⁺Canaan.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩⁺ ⸨err:Heb⸼⸩Heb⸨/err⸩ ⸨i⸩Chenaan⸨/i⸩.
₁₉ These ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
₂₀ And Noah began ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
₂₁ And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
₂₂ And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
₂₃ And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid ⸨i⸩it⸨/i⸩ upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ backward, and they saw not their fatherʼs nakedness.
₂₄ And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
₂₅ And he said, Cursed ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
₂₆ And he said, Blessed ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God of Shem; and Canaan shall be ˈhis servant.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩servant to them⸨/i⸩.
₂₇ God shall ˈenlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.⸨marg⸩⸨row⸩ˈ Or, ⸨i⸩persuade⸨/i⸩.
₂₈ ¶ And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
₂₉ And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
