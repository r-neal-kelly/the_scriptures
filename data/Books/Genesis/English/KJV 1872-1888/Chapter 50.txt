₁₇ So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.⸨marg⸩
₁₈ And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ thy servants.⸨marg⸩
