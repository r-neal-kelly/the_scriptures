⸨cen⸩CHAPTER VIII⸼
⸨i⸩⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ The waters asswage. ⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ The ark resteth on Ararat. ⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ The raven and the dove. ⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ Noah, being commanded, ⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ goeth forth of the ark. ⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ He buildeth an altar, and offereth sacrifice, ⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ which God accepteth, and promiseth to curse the earth no more.⸨/i⸩

⸨sub⸩1⸨/sub⸩ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩2⸨/sub⸩ The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩3⸨/sub⸩ And the waters returned from off the earth ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ in ⸨i⸩going and returning⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩4⸨/sub⸩ And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩5⸨/sub⸩ And the waters ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth ⸨i⸩month⸨/i⸩, on the first ⸨i⸩day⸨/i⸩ of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ were ⸨i⸩in going and decreasing⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩6⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩7⸨/sub⸩ And he sent forth a raven, which went forth ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ in ⸨i⸩going forth and returning⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩8⸨/sub⸩ Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩9⸨/sub⸩ But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩pulled her in unto him into the ark.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩caused her to come⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩10⸨/sub⸩ And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩11⸨/sub⸩ And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩12⸨/sub⸩ And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩13⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first ⸨i⸩month⸨/i⸩, the first ⸨i⸩day⸨/i⸩ of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩14⸨/sub⸩ And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩15⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And God spake unto Noah, saying,⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩16⸨/sub⸩ Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sonsʼ wives with thee.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩17⸨/sub⸩ Bring forth with thee every living thing that ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ with thee, of all flesh, ⸨i⸩both⸨/i⸩ of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩18⸨/sub⸩ And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sonsʼ wives with him:⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩19⸨/sub⸩ Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩kinds, went forth out of the ark.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ Heb⸼ ⸨i⸩families⸨/i⸩.
⸨sub⸩20⸨/sub⸩ ¶ And Noah builded an altar unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.⸨marg⸩
⸨sub⸩21⸨/sub⸩ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ smelled ⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩a sweet savour; and the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for manʼs sake; for the ⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ imagination of manʼs heart ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.⸨marg⸩⸨sup⸩✝⸨/sup⸩ ⸨fix:Heb⸼⸩Heb⸨/fix⸩ ⸨i⸩a savour of rest⸨/i⸩.⸨row⸩⸨sup⸩⸨i⸩a⸨/i⸩⸨/sup⸩ chap⸼ 6⸼ 5⸼⸨row⸩⸨fix:Matt⸼⸩Matt⸨/fix⸩ 15⸼ 19⸼
