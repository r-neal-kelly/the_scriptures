₁ ⸨sc⸩Now⸨/sc⸩ when ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
₂ And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
₃ ¶ And Josephʼs ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
₄ But Benjamin, Josephʼs brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
₅ And the sons of Israel came to buy ⸨i⸩corn⸨/i⸩ among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
₆ And Joseph ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ the governor over the land, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ he ⸨i⸩it was⸨/i⸩ that sold to all the people of the land: and Josephʼs brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him ⸨i⸩with⸨/i⸩ their faces to the earth.
₇ And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake ⁺roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
₈ And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
₉ And Joseph ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
₁₀ And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
₁₁ We ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ all one manʼs sons; we ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ true ⸨i⸩men⸨/i⸩, thy servants are no spies.
₁₂ And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
₁₃ And they said, Thy servants ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this day with our father, and one ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not.
₁₄ And Joseph said unto them, That ⸨i⸩is it⸨/i⸩ that I spake unto you, saying, Ye ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ spies:
₁₅ Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
₁₆ Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be ⁺kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether ⸨i⸩there be any⸨/i⸩ truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ spies.
₁₇ And he ⁺put them all together into ward three days.
₁₈ And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; ⸨i⸩for⸨/i⸩ I fear God:
₁₉ If ye ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ true ⸨i⸩men⸨/i⸩, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
₂₀ But ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
₂₁ ¶ And they said one to another, We ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
₂₂ And Reuben answered them, saying, ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
₂₃ And they knew not that Joseph understood ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩; for ⁺he spake unto them by an interpreter.
₂₄ And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
₂₅ ¶ Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every manʼs money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
₂₆ And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
₂₇ And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in his sackʼs mouth.
₂₈ And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, ⸨i⸩it is⸨/i⸩ even in my sack: and their heart ⁺failed ⸨i⸩them⸨/i⸩, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ God hath done unto us?
₂₉ ¶ And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,
₃₀ The man, ⸨i⸩who is⸨/i⸩ the lord of the land, spake ⁺roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
₃₁ And we said unto him, We ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ true ⸨i⸩men⸨/i⸩; we are no spies:
₃₂ We ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ twelve brethren, sons of our father; one ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not, and the youngest ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
₃₃ And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ true ⸨i⸩men⸨/i⸩; leave one of your brethren ⸨i⸩here⸨/i⸩ with me, and take ⸨i⸩food for⸨/i⸩ the famine of your households, and be gone:
₃₄ And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ no spies, but ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ ye ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ true ⸨i⸩men⸨/i⸩: ⸨i⸩so⸨/i⸩ will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
₃₅ ¶ And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every manʼs bundle of money ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ in his sack: and when ⸨i⸩both⸨/i⸩ they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
₃₆ And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved ⸨i⸩of my children⸨/i⸩: Joseph ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not, and Simeon ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ not, and ye will take Benjamin ⸨i⸩away⸨/i⸩: all these things are against me.
₃₇ And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
₃₈ And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
