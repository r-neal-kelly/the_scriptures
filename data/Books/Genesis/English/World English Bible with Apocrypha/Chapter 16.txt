⸨in⸩⸨sup⸩1⸨/sup⸩ Now Sarai, Abramʼs wife, bore him no children. She had a servant, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. ⸨sup⸩2⸨/sup⸩ Sarai said to Abram, “See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to my servant. It may be that I will obtain children by her.” Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. ⸨sup⸩3⸨/sup⸩ Sarai, Abramʼs wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife. ⸨sup⸩4⸨/sup⸩ He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. ⸨sup⸩5⸨/sup⸩ Sarai said to Abram, “This wrong is your fault.

You shall call his name Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard your affliction. ⸨sup⸩12⸨/sup⸩ He will be like a wild donkey among men. His hand will be against every man, and every manʼs hand against him. He will live opposed to all of his brothers.”
⸨in⸩⸨sup⸩13⸨/sup⸩ She called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her, “You are a God who sees,” for she said, “Have I even stayed alive after seeing him?” ⸨sup⸩14⸨/sup⸩ Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi⸨fix:†. ⸩.† ⸨/fix⸩Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
