｟in｠12¹ And it came to pass in the sixth week, in the seventh year thereof, that Abram said to Terah his father, saying, ‘Father!’ And he said, ‘Behold, here am I, my son.’
² And he said,

｟in｠‘What help and profit have we from those idols which thou dost worship,
｟in｠And before which thou dost bow thyself?

｟in｠³ For there is no spirit in them,
｟in｠For they are dumb forms, and a misleading of the heart.
｟in｠Worship them not:

｟in｠⁴ Worship the God of heaven,
｟in｠Who causes the rain and the dew to descend on the earth
｟in｠And does everything upon the earth,

｟in｠And has created everything by His word,
｟in｠And all life is from before His face.

｟in｠⁵ Why do ye worship things that have no spirit in them?
｟in｠For they are the work of (menʼs) hands,

｟in｠And on your shoulders do ye bear them,
｟in｠And ye have no help from them,

｟in｠But they are a great cause of shame to those who make them,
｟in｠And a misleading of the heart to those who worship them:
｟in｠Worship them not.’

⁶ And his father said unto him, ‘I also know it, my son, but what shall I do with a people who have made me to serve before them?
⁷ And if I tell them the truth, they will slay me; for their soul cleaves to them to worship them and honour them. Keep silent, my son, lest they slay thee.’
⁸ And these words he spake to his two brothers, and they were angry with him and he kept silent.
⁹ And in the fortieth jubilee, in the second week, in the seventh year thereof, Abram took to himself a wife, and her name was Sarai, the daughter of his father, and she became his wife.
¹⁰ And Haran, his brother, took to himself a wife in the third year of the third week, and she bare him a son in the seventh year of this week, and he called his name Lot.
¹¹ And Nahor, his brother, took to himself a wife.
