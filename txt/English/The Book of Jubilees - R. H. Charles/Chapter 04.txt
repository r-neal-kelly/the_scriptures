｟in｠4¹ And in the third week in the second jubileeᵃ she gave birth to Cain, and in the fourthᵇ she gave birth to Abel, and in the fifthᶜ she gave birth to her daughter Âwân.
² And in the first (year) of the third ｟err｠jubilee,ᵈ｟/err｠ Cain slew Abel because (God) accepted the sacrifice of Abel, and did not accept the offering of Cain.
³ And he slew him in the field: and his blood cried from the ground to heaven, complaining because he had slain him.
⁴ And the Lord reproved Cain because of Abel, because he had slain him, and he made him a ｟b｠fugitive｟/b｠ on the earth because of the blood of his brother, and he cursed him upon the earth.
⁵ And on this account it is written on the heavenly tables, ‘Cursed is he who smites his neighbour treacherously, and let all who have seen and heard say, So be it; and the man who has seen and not declared (it), let him be accursed as the other.’
⁶ And for this reason we announce when we come before the Lord our God all the sin which is committed in heaven and on earth, and in light and in darkness, and everywhere.
⁷ And Adam and his wife mourned for Abel four weeks of years, and in the fourth year of the fifth week they became joyful, and Adam knew his wife again, and she bare him a son, and he called his name Seth; for he said｟err｠｟/err｠ ‘｟sc｠God｟/sc｠ has raised up a second seed unto us on the earth instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.’
