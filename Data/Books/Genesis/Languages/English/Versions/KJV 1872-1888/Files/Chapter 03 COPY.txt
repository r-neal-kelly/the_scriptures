⸨cen⸩CHAPTER III⸼
⸨i⸩₁ The serpent deceiveth Eve. ₆ Manʼs shameful fall. ₉ God arraigneth them. ₁₄ The serpent is cursed. ₁₅ The promised seed. ₁₆ The punishment of mankind. ₂₁ Their first clothing. ₂₂ Their casting out of paradise.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩Now⸨/sc⸩ the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God had made. And he said unto the woman, ⁺Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
₂ And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
₃ But of the fruit of the tree which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
₄ ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
₅ For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
₆ And when the woman saw that the tree ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ good for food, and that it ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ ⁺pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make ⸨i⸩one⸨/i⸩ wise, she took of the fruit thereof, ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
₇ And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves ˈaprons.
₈ And they heard the voice of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God walking in the garden in the ⁺cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God amongst the trees of the garden.
₉ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ thou?
₁₀ And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ naked; and I hid myself.
₁₁ And he said, Who told thee that thou ⸨i⸩wast⸨/i⸩ naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
₁₂ And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest ⸨i⸩to be⸨/i⸩ with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
₁₃ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God said unto the woman, What ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ this ⸨i⸩that⸨/i⸩ thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
₁₄ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
₁₅ And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; and it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
₁₆ Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire ⸨i⸩shall be⸨/i⸩ ˈto thy husband, and he shall ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ rule over thee.
₁₇ And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat ⸨i⸩of⸨/i⸩ it all the days of thy life;
₁₈ Thorns also and thistles shall it ⁺bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
₁₉ In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩, and unto dust shalt thou return.
₂₀ And Adam called his wifeʼs name ⁺Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
₂₁ Unto Adam also and to his wife did the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
₂₂ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
₂₃ Therefore the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
₂₄ So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
