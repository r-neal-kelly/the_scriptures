⸨cen⸩CHAPTER XIII⸼
⸨i⸩₁ Abram and Lot return out of Egypt. ₇ By disagreement they part asunder. ₁₀ Lot goeth to wicked Sodom. ₁₄ God reneweth the promise to Abram. ₁₈ He removeth to Hebron, and there buildeth an altar.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
₂ And Abram ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
₃ And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
₄ Unto the ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
₅ ¶ And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
₆ And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
₇ And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abramʼs cattle and the herdmen of Lotʼs cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
₈ And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we ⸨i⸩be⸨/i⸩ ⁺brethren.
₉ ⸨i⸩Is⸨/i⸩ not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if ⸨i⸩thou wilt take⸨/i⸩ the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if ⸨i⸩thou depart⸨/i⸩ to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
₁₀ And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ well watered every where, before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, ⸨i⸩even⸨/i⸩ as the garden of the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
₁₁ Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
₁₂ Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ tent toward Sodom.
₁₃ But the men of Sodom ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ wicked and sinners before the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ exceedingly.
₁₄ ¶ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
₁₅ For all the land which thou seest, ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
₁₆ And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, ⸨i⸩then⸨/i⸩ shall thy seed also be numbered.
₁₇ Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.
₁₈ Then Abram removed ⸨i⸩his⸨/i⸩ tent, and came and dwelt in the ⁺plain of Mamre, which ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩.
