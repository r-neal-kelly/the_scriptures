⸨cen⸩CHAPTER XI⸼
⸨i⸩₁ One language in the world. ₃ The building of Babel. ₅ The confusion of tongues. ₁₀ The generations of Shem. ₂₇ The generations of Terah the father of Abram. ₃₁ Terah goeth from Ur to Haran.⸨/i⸩

₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ the whole earth was of one ⁺language, and of one ⁺speech.
₂ And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
₃ And ⁺they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and ⁺burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
₄ And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top ⸨i⸩may reach⸨/i⸩ unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
₅ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
₆ And the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ said, Behold, the people ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
₇ Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one anotherʼs speech.
₈ So the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
₉ Therefore is the name of it called ˈBabel; because the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the ⸨sc⸩Lord⸨/sc⸩ scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
₁₀ ¶ ⸨i⸩ᵇ⸨/i⸩ These ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the generations of Shem: Shem ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:
₁₁ And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
₁₂ And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:
₁₃ And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
₁₄ And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
₁₅ And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
₁₆ ⸨i⸩ᶜ⸨/i⸩ And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ Peleg:
₁₇ And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
₁₈ And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
₁₉ And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
₂₀ And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat ⸨i⸩ᵉ⸨/i⸩ Serug:
₂₁ And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
₂₂ And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
₂₃ And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
₂₄ And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat ⸨i⸩ᶠ⸨/i⸩ Terah:
₂₅ And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
₂₆ And Terah lived seventy years, and ⸨i⸩ᵍ⸨/i⸩ begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
₂₇ ¶ Now these ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
₂₈ And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
₂₉ And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abramʼs wife ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Sarai; and the name of Nahorʼs wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
₃₀ But Sarai was barren; she ⸨i⸩had⸨/i⸩ no child.
₃₁ And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his sonʼs son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abramʼs wife; and they went forth with them from ⸨i⸩ʰ⸨/i⸩ Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
₃₂ And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
