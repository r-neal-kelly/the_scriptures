⁵ And the Lord executed a great vengeance on them for Israelʼs sake, and smote them through (the plagues of) blood and frogs, lice and dog‑flies, and malignant boils breaking forth in blains; and their cattle by death; and by hail‑stones, thereby He destroyed everything that grew for them; and by locusts which devoured the residue which had been left by the hail, and by darkness; and ⟨by the death⟩ of the first‑born of men and animals, and on all their idols the Lord took vengeance and burned them with fire.
