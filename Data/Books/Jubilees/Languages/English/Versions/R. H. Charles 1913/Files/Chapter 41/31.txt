²⁶ And do thou command the children of Israel that there be no uncleanness amongst them, for every one who lies with his daughter‑in‑law or with his mother‑in‑law hath wrought uncleanness; with fire let them burn the man who has lain with her, and likewise the woman, and He will turn away wrath and punishment from Israel.
