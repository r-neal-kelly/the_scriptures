²² And the Lord our God said unto us: ‘Behold, they are one people, and (this) they begin to do, and now nothing will be withholden from them. Go to, let ⸨err⸩us⸨/err⸩ go down and confound their language, that they may not understand one anotherʼs speech, and they may be dispersed into cities and nations, and one purpose will no longer abide with them till the day of judgment.’
