¹³ ‘Behold the people of the children of Israel have increased and multiplied more than we. Come and let us deal wisely with them before they become too many, and let us afflict them with slavery before war come upon us and before they too fight against us; else they will join themselves unto ⸨b⸩our enemies⸨/b⸩ and get them up out of our land, for their hearts and faces are towards the land of Canaan.’
