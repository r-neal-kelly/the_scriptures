³² And command thou the children of Israel that they observe the years according to this reckoning—three hundred and sixty‑four days, and (these) will constitute a complete year, and they will not disturb its time from its days and from its feasts; for everything will fall out in them according to their testimony, and they will not leave out any day nor disturb any feasts.
