²⁹ Declare and say to the children of Israel the law of this day both that they should keep Sabbath thereon, and that they should not forsake it in the error of their hearts; (and) that it is not lawful to do any work thereon which is ⸨b⸩unseemly⸨/b⸩, to do thereon their own pleasure, and that they should not prepare thereon anything to be eaten or drunk, †and (that it is not lawful) to draw water, or bring in or take out thereon through their gates any burden,† which they had not prepared for themselves on the sixth day in their dwellings.
