# The Scriptures

**[Read Online](https://r-neal-kelly.github.io/the_scriptures/)**

Currently adding the Prolegomenon from the same Hexaglot we've copied the Pentateuch from.

After that, we will start on Joshua in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and English, sourced from the same Hexaglot.

Also still working on Wellhausen's Prolegomena in English, but on the side.
