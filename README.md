# The Scriptures

A Scriptural Study Suite containing numerous versions of the Bible in multiple languages. Includes both canonical and uncanonical texts, as well as other texts that assist with the study of the Scriptures.

Currently comes with a **browser** to read various texts in the program and a **finder** to search those texts.

## Status

Adding the *Prolegomenon* from *The Hexaglot Bible* we've already copied the Pentateuch in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and English from. After that, we will start working on *Joshua*, sourced from the same Hexaglot. First we may add the German and the French of the Pentateuch, and then as we move forward, we'll add all six languages simultaneously for each book.

Additionally, we're adding an 1800's copy of the *King James Version* that faithfully keeps all the original marginal notes intact, and the *World English Bible with Apocrypha* alongside it.

Also, periodically working on Wellhausen's *Prolegomena to the History of Israel*.

We have plenty of other materials planned for addition into the program as we proceed forwards.
