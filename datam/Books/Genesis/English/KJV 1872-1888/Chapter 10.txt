₁₈ And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
₁₉ And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto ⁺Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.
₂₀ These ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ in their nations.

₂₅ ⸨i⸩ᵈ⸨/i⸩ And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brotherʼs name ⸨i⸩was⸨/i⸩ Joktan.

₃₂ These ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
