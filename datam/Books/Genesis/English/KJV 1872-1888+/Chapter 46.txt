₁ ⸨sc⸩And⸨/sc⸩ Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer‑sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
₂ And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ I.
₃ And he said, I ⸨i⸩am⸨/i⸩ God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
₄ I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up ⸨i⸩again⸨/i⸩: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
₅ And Jacob rose up from Beer‑sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
₆ And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, ⸨i⸩ᵃ⸨/i⸩ Jacob, and all his seed with him:
₇ His sons, and his sonsʼ sons with him, his daughters, and his sonsʼ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.

₂₄ ¶ And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
₂₅ These ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ seven.
₂₆ ⸨i⸩ˡ⸨/i⸩ All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his ⁺loins, besides Jacobʼs sonsʼ wives, all the souls ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ threescore and six;
₂₇ And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ threescore and ten.
₂₈ ¶ And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
₂₉ And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
₃₀ And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou ⸨i⸩art⸨/i⸩ yet alive.
₃₁ And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his fatherʼs house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my fatherʼs house, which ⸨i⸩were⸨/i⸩ in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
₃₂ And the men ⸨i⸩are⸨/i⸩ shepherds, for ⁺their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
₃₃ And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ your occupation?
₃₄ That ye shall say, Thy servantsʼ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, ⸨i⸩and⸨/i⸩ also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd ⸨i⸩is⸨/i⸩ an abomination unto the Egyptians.
